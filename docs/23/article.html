      <h2 id="what-is-constellation">1. What Is Constellation?</h2>
      <p>Constellation is NOIZ’s secure identity and token access system — acting as the central bridge between your NOIZ account, Decibel balances, and platform-linked tools.</p>
      <p>Rather than using usernames and passwords, NOIZ uses code-based handshakes and device-based authorization to authenticate your identity and maintain session control.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>⚠️ Constellation is not a wallet and not a crypto product. It is a private identity keychain and platform ledger viewer.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Constellation handles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Account login and identity authentication</li>
        <li>Session linking between your device and NOIZ</li>
        <li>Tracking of both dB (faded Decibels) and ⚡︎dB (charged, earned Decibels)</li>
        <li>Secure access to platform features like monetization, Marketplace, and KYC tools</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="how-linking-works">2. How Linking Works</h2>
      <p>To connect your NOIZ account to Constellation:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Visit NOIZ and request a connection token</li>
        <li>Open Constellation App
          <ul>
            <li>If you're new, Register:
              <ul>
                <li>Paste the token and generate a 6-digit handshake code</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If you’re already linked, Authorize:
              <ul>
                <li>Select NOIZ under “Active Connections” and generate a new handshake code</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Return to NOIZ</li>
        <li>Paste your 6-digit code to complete the sync</li>
      </ol>
      <p>✅ Once completed, your NOIZ account is cryptographically tied to your Constellation identity — no passwords, usernames, or emails needed.</p>

      <h2 id="what-constellation-tracks">3. What Constellation Tracks</h2>
      <p>Constellation provides a clear record of your identity and digital token interactions within the NOIZ ecosystem, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>dB</strong>: Your purchased (faded) Decibel balance</li>
        <li><strong>⚡︎dB</strong>: Your earned (charged) support tokens eligible for cashout</li>
        <li><strong>Platform Connections</strong>: Your active NOIZ-linked accounts</li>
        <li><strong>Marketplace Activity</strong>: Listing history, asset unlock logs, and Creator support (if applicable)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="custody-and-safety">4. Custody and Safety</h2>
      <p>Constellation does not behave like a wallet. You do not “hold” tokens personally — you view and manage them via a secure, platform-maintained ledger.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Decibels are not stored locally or in a personal wallet</li>
        <li>There are no “seed phrases,” crypto keys, or private credentials</li>
        <li>Your Decibel balances exist within the NOIZ platform, viewable and controlled through Constellation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All balances (dB and ⚡︎dB) are ledgered by the platform and remain protected until used or redeemed.</p>

      <h2 id="requesting-withdrawals">5. Requesting Withdrawals (⚡︎dB Only)</h2>
      <p>To request a cashout of earned Decibels:</p>
      <p>✅ <strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be Affiliate tier or higher</li>
        <li>Hold ≥ 10,000 ⚡︎dB</li>
        <li>Complete KYC identity verification</li>
        <li>Pass platform review for fraud/security compliance</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Once eligible:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visit Creator Dashboard → ⚡︎dB → Cashout</li>
        <li>Confirm withdrawal destination</li>
        <li>Track processing via payout status panel</li>
      </ul>
      <p>❌ dB (faded) cannot be withdrawn — only ⚡︎dB earned through legitimate user support.</p>

      <h2 id="security-tips">6. Security Tips</h2>
      <p>To keep your account safe:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enable device locking in the Constellation app</li>
        <li>Never share your handshake code with others</li>
        <li>Use 2FA (two-factor authentication) in Constellation for payout and KYC tools</li>
        <li>Monitor session history in Active Connections and log out of old devices when needed</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="what-constellation-is-not">7. What Constellation Is Not</h2>
      <p>To prevent confusion with financial products:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>❌ Not a crypto wallet</li>
        <li>❌ Not a bank</li>
        <li>❌ Not an exchange</li>
        <li>❌ Not a payment processor</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is simply a platform-specific identity tool that enables creators and viewers to safely use Decibels and access monetization features within NOIZ.</p>
      <p>You do not need Constellation to just spend dB — it’s only required for managing support, listings, cashouts, and creator tools.</p>

      <h2 id="faq">8. FAQ</h2>
      <p><strong>Q: What if I lose my device?</strong><br>
      A: You can reauthorize your Constellation account from a new device by verifying your identity and revoking the previous session.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: Can I link other platforms through Constellation?</strong><br>
      A: Currently, Constellation is used only for NOIZ. Future integrations may expand to additional creator tools.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: Can I cash out from Constellation directly?</strong><br>
      A: No. Cashouts are initiated via the NOIZ Creator Dashboard and processed through our payout provider, not through Constellation.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: What if my dB and ⚡︎dB look different?</strong><br>
      A: This is normal. dB = what you've purchased and spent. ⚡︎dB = what you’ve earned through support. Only ⚡︎dB is eligible for cashout.</p>
