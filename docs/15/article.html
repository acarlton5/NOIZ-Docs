      <h2 id="the-power-of-interactive-support">The Power of Interactive Support</h2>
      <p>NOIZ is built on active, meaningful participation. Instead of relying on passive metrics like view counts, the platform rewards direct interaction — and viewer support plays a key role in that system.</p>
      <p>Actions like gifting subs, boosting live streams, and completing quests all contribute to a creator’s visibility and progression. These actions are powered by Decibels (dB), NOIZ’s virtual support tokens, which are never framed as money or purchases.</p>
      <p>Interactive support benefits everyone:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Viewers unlock cosmetic perks, badge milestones, and personal rewards</li>
        <li>Creators earn ⚡︎dB, increase their Echostage eligibility, and make measurable progress</li>
        <li>The system reinforces community interaction without being pay-to-win or performance-ranked</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="sub-gifting-how-it-works">Sub Gifting: How It Works</h2>
      <p>Viewers can gift subscriptions to others on NOIZ using 500 dB per sub. This is a support action, not a purchase — it unlocks non-financial, digital perks for both the recipient and the creator.</p>
      <p>Recipients of a gifted sub receive:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A sub badge, which may be time-based or custom</li>
        <li>Access to exclusive emotes, overlays, audio, or channel perks (if enabled)</li>
        <li>Entry into sub-gated Quests or features</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Gifting subs also contributes to milestone badges, visible to the gifter. These include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250…</li>
        <li>…continuing in 1,000-point intervals up to 5,000+</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Creators receive ⚡︎dB from each gifted sub. These are immediately added to their earnings, provided they meet monetization eligibility.</p>
      <p>Gifting does not grant ownership of anything — it’s a show of support, and non-refundable once processed.</p>

      <h2 id="boosting-streams">Boosting Streams</h2>
      <p>Boosts are viewer-driven visibility surges powered by Decibels or Reverb.</p>
      <p>Boosting a live stream can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Raise Echostage placement probability</li>
        <li>Temporarily activate Boost Mode in chat (enhanced emotes, effects, visual density)</li>
        <li>Trigger Hype Moment sequences (if collective activity thresholds are met)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Boosts are non-guaranteed — meaning:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They don’t directly alter payouts or guarantee spotlighting</li>
        <li>They decay over time unless renewed through additional engagement</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Where enabled, Reverb and Decibel boosts can combine for increased effect.</p>
      <p>Boosting yourself is discouraged and doesn’t count toward progression systems.</p>

      <h2 id="quest-bonuses">Quest Bonuses</h2>
      <p>Quests are interactive challenges built into the NOIZ platform. When completed, they can trigger Quest Bonuses — additional perks for creators and viewers alike.</p>
      <p>Bonus types may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>dB rewards for viewers</li>
        <li>Milestone progress for both viewer and creator</li>
        <li>Temporary Echostage weight boosts, if many quests are completed quickly</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some Quest bonuses are sponsored, meaning they’re backed by verified brands or funded by NOIZ campaigns.</p>
      <p>All Quest bonuses remain virtual and platform-contained — no fiat currency or off-platform goods are involved.</p>

      <h2 id="how-creators-benefit">How Creators Benefit</h2>
      <p>Creators gain ⚡︎dB and increased visibility from viewer actions such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Receiving gifted subs</li>
        <li>Having quests completed (if linked to their stream)</li>
        <li>Being boosted during a live broadcast</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These actions impact platform progression by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Counting toward Partner or Partner+ tiers</li>
        <li>Unlocking Vibe milestone badges</li>
        <li>Influencing dashboard stats and engagement insights</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Boosts, in particular, affect Echostage routing only when fueled by viewer engagement — not raw currency or automation.</p>
      <p>There is no leaderboard or payout bonus for boosts — they are a visibility tool, not a monetization mechanic.</p>

      <h2 id="boost-gift-transparency">Boost &amp; Gift Transparency</h2>
      <p>All support actions are visible in stream alerts and analytics dashboards unless privacy mode is enabled.</p>
      <p>Streamers can track:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Top gifters</li>
        <li>Boost streaks or spikes</li>
        <li>Quest completions and bonus chains</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Viewers cannot boost or gift anonymously unless they’ve activated privacy settings — helping keep community activity transparent and accountable.</p>

      <h2 id="support-vs-purchase-reminder">Support vs. Purchase Reminder</h2>
      <p>It’s important to understand that NOIZ does not sell access, perks, or content.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gifting, boosting, and completing quests are support actions, not transactions</li>
        <li>Streamers receive ⚡︎dB as recognition, not as payment or product compensation</li>
        <li>All interactions are framed as voluntary digital contributions within a virtual ecosystem</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This ensures that NOIZ remains legally compliant, creator-first, and free from transactional expectations.</p>

      <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Can I boost my own stream?</strong><br>Technically yes, but boosts initiated by the creator using their own dB do not count toward Echostage or progression metrics.</li>
        <li><strong>Do boosts expire or decay?</strong><br>Yes. Boost influence degrades over time unless sustained by new viewer engagement or activity.</li>
        <li><strong>What’s the best way to encourage Quest bonuses?</strong><br>Keep your active Quests achievable, rotate them regularly, and encourage viewers to redeem Reverb or dB at key moments (e.g., during gameplay highs or community milestones).</li>
        <li><strong>Do viewers get anything for gifting a sub?</strong><br>Yes. Gift milestones unlock exclusive badges for gifters, and some channels may offer bonus visuals or commands for recognized supporters.</li>
