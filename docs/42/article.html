      <blockquote>
        <p>Submitting an appeal does not guarantee reversal ‚Äî but your explanation helps DCT review the case fairly.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="what-happens-after-you-submit">What Happens After You Submit</h2>
      <p>Appeals are reviewed by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>DCT for standard moderation cases</li>
        <li>Staff Admin for escalated or legal-impact situations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>‚è±Ô∏è Timeline:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Most appeals are reviewed within 24‚Äì72 hours</li>
        <li>Escalated cases may take up to 5 business days</li>

      </ul>

      <h2 id="how-many-times-can-i-appeal">How Many Times Can I Appeal?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>One appeal per enforcement action</li>
        <li>If you have new evidence, you may request a second look</li>
        <li>Submitting multiple appeals without justification may result in your appeal being ignored</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="respecting-the-process">Respecting the Process</h2>
      <p>Appeals are a formal process, not a shortcut to reinstatement.</p>
      <p>üö´ Do not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Harass moderators, DCT, or staff about your appeal</li>
        <li>Encourage mass reporting or retaliation</li>
        <li>Bypass a ban using alternate accounts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Doing so will void your current appeal and may result in escalated enforcement.</p>

      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Q: What if my account was hacked?</strong><br>A: Include this in your appeal. Security cases may be reviewed separately by Support and DCT.</li>
        <li><strong>Q: Can I appeal a chat mute or local timeout?</strong><br>A: No ‚Äî local channel moderation is controlled by the streamer and their mod team.</li>
        <li><strong>Q: What if I didn‚Äôt get a chance to explain before the suspension?</strong><br>A: You can include your context in the appeal form. First-time actions often allow for review.</li>
        <li><strong>Q: Can I appeal on someone else‚Äôs behalf?</strong><br>A: No ‚Äî appeals must be submitted by the affected account holder for privacy and verification reasons.</li>
