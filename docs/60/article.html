<p>Whether you’re sharing a developer reveal or letting a guest run your channel, this guide covers what’s allowed — and what you’re accountable for.</p>

<h2 id="1-what-is-co-streaming-on-noiz">1. What Is Co-streaming on NOIZ?</h2>
<p><strong>Co-streaming</strong> = Multiple streamers covering the <strong>same event</strong> on their own channels — often in sync, with commentary, visuals, or overlays.</p>
<p>Common use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Game reveals and developer showcases</li>
<li>Sponsored Quests with co-op or sync conditions</li>
<li>Tournament reactions or shared gameplay</li>
<li>Partner-approved media (trailers, demos, livestreams)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>❗ Co-streaming is <strong>not</strong> the same as rebroadcasting someone else’s stream.
There must be commentary, transformation, or synchronized participation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="2-what-is-a-stream-takeover">2. What Is a Stream Takeover?</h2>
<p>A <strong>Stream Takeover</strong> = Allowing another verified user to go live <strong>directly on your channel</strong> — using your chat, overlays, and layout.</p>
<p>Great for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guest creators</li>
<li>Charitable or mod-hosted events</li>
<li>Developer Q&amp;A</li>
<li>Artist spotlights</li>
</ul>
<p>Takeovers require <strong>explicit access</strong>, either through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your dashboard (one-time keys or permissions)</li>
<li>A plugin managing stream access with delegated credentials</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-what-s-allowed-in-co-streaming">3. What’s Allowed in Co-streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li>React to licensed or authorized game/event content</li>
<li>Use the Multi-View plugin to merge audio or split screens</li>
<li>Run synchronized quests or challenges with another streamer</li>
<li>Co-stream NOIZ-sponsored broadcasts (if listed as eligible)</li>

</ul>

<li>Shared gameplay with distinct overlays</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-what-s-not-allowed">4. What’s Not Allowed</h2>
<p>🚫 You <strong>may not</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restream another user’s full stream without collaboration</li>
<li>Claim someone else’s gameplay or footage as your own</li>
<li>Re-air copyrighted media without commentary/transformation</li>

<li>Let guests run takeovers that violate your channel’s maturity rating or rules</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-stream-takeover-rules">5. Stream Takeover Rules</h2>
<p>If you let someone else stream on your channel:</p>
<p>🛑 <strong>You are responsible for everything that happens.</strong></p>
<p>Required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tag the stream correctly (e.g., Mature, 18+, etc.)</li>
<li>Be available to <strong>revoke access instantly</strong> if needed</li>
<li>Only grant access via dashboard or verified plugins</li>
</ul>
<p>Go to:</p>
<p>→ <strong>Dashboard → Channel Access → Guest Streamer</strong></p>
<p>From there, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue time-limited stream keys</li>
<li>Restrict overlays, bitrate, resolution</li>
<li>Schedule takeovers and auto-revoke</li>
<li>Monitor usage logs in real time</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="6-visual-layouts-plugin-support">6. Visual Layouts &amp; Plugin Support</h2>
<p>NOIZ supports:</p>

<li><strong>PiP overlays</strong> for commentary or guests</li>
<li><strong>Audio channel control</strong> (volume separation, mute priority)</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Quest plugins</strong> (for synchronized events)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>These tools are optional — but make co-streaming smoother and safer.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="7-monetization-rules-for-co-streams">7. Monetization Rules for Co-streams</h2>
<p>⚡︎dB and boosts always go to the <strong>channel being streamed on</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Guests <strong>do not earn</strong> from your viewers unless:<ul>
<li>The stream is mirrored on their own channel</li>
<li>They are also part of the registered Quest campaign</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>📌 If part of a <strong>sponsored Quest</strong>, follow the campaign’s co-streaming rules:</p>
<ul>

<li>Dual streams may not be eligible for reward milestones unless approved</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="8-faq">8. FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Can I co-stream Twitch, Kick, or YouTube content?</strong>
→ Only if you have rights or it’s public domain (e.g. game trailers, esports broadcasts with co-stream rights)</p>
<p><strong>Can my guest earn ⚡︎dB while using my stream?</strong>
→ No — your channel receives all earnings unless they co-broadcast on their own profile</p>
<p><strong>Can I limit plugin use or overlays during a takeover?</strong>
→ Yes — guest settings let you lock overlays, plugins, and stream inputs</p>
<p><strong>What happens if my guest breaks the rules?</strong>
→ <strong>Your channel is liable.</strong> Violations during takeovers are treated as if you streamed them directly</p>
