      <h2 id="platform-overview">What Is NOIZ as a Platform?</h2>
      <p>NOIZ is a creator-first live streaming ecosystem that reimagines how digital support and infrastructure work together.</p>
      <p>Unlike traditional platforms that prioritize monetization through fiat-based transactions or advertising, NOIZ centers its economy around Decibels — a virtual support token system. This framing allows NOIZ to foster community-driven growth, non-exploitative monetization, and meaningful interaction across the platform.</p>
      <p>Rather than relying on centralized server farms, NOIZ is powered by a decentralized relay infrastructure, hosted by users who contribute bandwidth and routing (Pathweavers). The entire system is designed to be lightweight, scalable, and fair — without relying on crypto, ads, or pay-to-win mechanics.</p>

      <h2 id="channels">Channels: Your Creator Hub</h2>
      <p>Each verified user on NOIZ has a channel — their home base for broadcasting, engaging with viewers, and customizing their community experience.</p>
      <p>A NOIZ channel includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your live video stream (with viewer-adjustable quality and latency settings)</li>
        <li>A custom channel banner, bio, and linked socials</li>
        <li>A fully-featured chat system with moderation controls and bot plugin integration</li>
        <li>The ability to set up Reverb (channel points), interactive Quests, and visual badges</li>
        <li>Channel-specific boosts, overlays, and command shortcuts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Viewers passively earn Reverb just by being present and interacting, which can then be spent on channel-specific redemptions, visual effects, or boosts.</p>
      <p>Channels evolve as creators grow — additional tools and cosmetic unlocks are added automatically through progression.</p>

      <h2 id="streams">Streams: How Broadcasting Works on NOIZ</h2>
      <p>NOIZ supports streaming via two methods:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>NOIZ Studio, a customized OBS fork tailored for platform-native integration</li>
        <li>Standard OBS with a modified configuration, supporting the ITGl routing system</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Low-latency streaming is the default behavior on NOIZ. This enables highly responsive chat interactions and better integration with time-sensitive features like Quests and Boosts.</p>
      <p>Additional stream capabilities include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Embedded streams on external sites</li>
        <li>Boostable visibility via Reverb or Decibel contributions</li>
        <li>Raiding other creators post-stream</li>
        <li>Eligibility for Echostage, NOIZ’s dynamic spotlight algorithm</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Unlike platforms with fixed bitrate tiers, NOIZ dynamically adjusts transcodes and quality levels based on viewer activity and infrastructure availability — ensuring consistent performance without punishing creators for lower viewership.</p>

      <h2 id="quests">Quests: Dynamic Viewer Interaction</h2>
      <p>Quests are a core part of NOIZ’s interactive ecosystem.</p>
      <p>They are goal-based challenges that encourage viewers to engage in meaningful ways, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Watching for a certain amount of time</li>
        <li>Sending chat messages</li>
        <li>Triggering overlays or boosts</li>
        <li>Gifting subs or completing event actions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Upon completion, viewers may receive:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>dB (faded Decibels)</li>
        <li>Cosmetic badges or in-stream visuals</li>
        <li>Progress toward long-term milestones</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some quests are created by creators. Others are sponsored — meaning they're funded by games, brands, or NOIZ itself.</p>
      <p>Importantly, all quest mechanics are action-based and cannot be bought or skipped — preserving a fair, community-first experience.</p>

      <h2 id="relays">Relays: The Backbone of NOIZ Infrastructure</h2>
      <p>Unlike traditional centralized streaming platforms, NOIZ runs on a relay node network hosted by trusted members of the community — called Pathweavers.</p>
      <p>Relays are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lightweight servers that forward stream data to viewers</li>
        <li>Selected automatically based on trust, latency, and uptime</li>
        <li>Never responsible for moderation or content — only delivery</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Relay operators can earn ⚡︎dB (charged Decibels) as a recognition of their contribution to infrastructure uptime and load balancing.</p>
      <p>Relay performance is monitored internally by the platform, using metrics like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Packet integrity</li>
        <li>Latency stability</li>
        <li>Route reliability</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is no crypto mining, no proof-of-work, and no speculative earning — only platform-controlled recognition for valuable backend participation.</p>

      <h2 id="connections">How Everything Connects</h2>
      <p>At NOIZ, the ecosystem is tightly interwoven. Here’s how each system fits together:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Channels are where creators manage their stream, community, and engagement tools.</li>
        <li>Streams deliver the content — handled by optimized software and routed through trusted relays.</li>
        <li>Quests turn passive viewers into active participants by rewarding them for supporting and engaging with the stream.</li>
        <li>Relays distribute the stream with low latency and resilience, ensuring smooth playback even during peak load.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All of this is powered by Decibels, which come in two forms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>dB — unlocked by viewers for use on the platform (not eligible for redemption)</li>
        <li>⚡︎dB — earned by creators through support and eligible for redemption (if monetization requirements are met)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Every action — whether you're watching, boosting, hosting a relay, or broadcasting — feeds into this system, ensuring that everyone’s contribution is recognized.</p>
