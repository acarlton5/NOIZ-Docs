      <h2 id="what-are-decibels">What Are Decibels?</h2>
      <p><strong>Decibels (dB)</strong> are NOIZ‚Äôs <strong>official virtual support tokens</strong>, designed to power platform interactions without relying on real-world money, advertising, or cryptocurrency systems.</p>
      <p>They are used to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Support creators</strong> through actions like subscriptions, tipping, and boosts</li>
        <li><strong>Unlock cosmetic rewards</strong> like badges, emotes, visual effects, and quests</li>
        <li><strong>Enable platform engagement</strong> such as viewer quests, gifting, and stream boosts</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Decibels are not a cryptocurrency, not an investment vehicle, and <strong>do not hold monetary value outside of NOIZ</strong>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>They are designed solely for <strong>platform-contained use</strong> and <strong>reward-based interaction</strong>.</p>

        <thead>
          <tr><th>Token Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Can Be Cashed Out?</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td><code>dB</code></td><td>Purchased virtual tokens, used to support creators</td><td>‚ùå No</td></tr>
          <tr><td><code>‚ö°Ô∏édB</code></td><td>‚ÄúCharged‚Äù Decibels earned through viewer support or platform interaction</td><td>‚úÖ Yes (if monetization requirements are met)</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <ul>
        <li><code>dB</code> = <strong>Faded Decibels</strong> (viewers purchase and spend them)</li>
        <li><code>‚ö°Ô∏édB</code> = <strong>Charged Decibels</strong> (creators receive them through viewer actions)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once <code>dB</code> is used to support another creator, it is transformed into <code>‚ö°Ô∏édB</code> and becomes eligible for cashout <strong>if</strong> the recipient has completed platform verification and monetization requirements.</p>

      <h3 id="as-a-viewer">As a Viewer</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Subscribe</strong> to creators using 500 dB</li>
        <li><strong>Boost</strong> a stream to help Echostage visibility</li>
        <li><strong>Gift</strong> subs to other viewers</li>
        <li><strong>Complete quests</strong> (some may require dB contributions)</li>
        <li><strong>Unlock cosmetic items or rewards</strong> via in-platform listings</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="as-a-creator-streamer-artist-developer">As a Creator (Streamer / Artist / Developer)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Receive ‚ö°Ô∏édB</strong> from viewer support (subs, boosts, quests, plugin usage)</li>
        <li><strong>Redeem ‚ö°Ô∏édB</strong> once eligible (Affiliate level, 10,000 ‚ö°Ô∏édB minimum)</li>
        <li><strong>Use your dB or ‚ö°Ô∏édB</strong> to support other creators, participate in quests, or unlock features</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="how-supply-works">How Supply Works</h2>
      <p>Unlike cryptocurrencies, NOIZ <strong>does not use a decentralized minting process</strong>. All Decibel supply is <strong>centrally controlled</strong> to maintain legal compliance and platform integrity.</p>
      <p><strong>dB:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Created when a user <strong>purchases them via Constellation</strong></li>
        <li>Marked as ‚Äúfaded‚Äù and cannot be withdrawn</li>
        <li>Non-refundable once used for support</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>‚ö°Ô∏édB:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Created when dB is used <strong>to support a creator</strong></li>
        <li>Assigned to that creator‚Äôs account as <strong>Charged Decibels</strong></li>
        <li>Can be <strong>cashed out</strong> only if the creator is eligible (Affiliate+, verified, and over 10,000 ‚ö°Ô∏édB)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If support activity is found to be fraudulent (e.g., self-tipping or bot abuse), ‚ö°Ô∏édB may be <strong>flagged and removed</strong>.</p>

      <h2 id="how-decibels-stay-balanced">How Decibels Stay Balanced</h2>
      <p>There is no finite ‚Äútotal supply‚Äù of Decibels. Instead, the system is <strong>usage-based</strong> and <strong>regulated internally</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The platform mints new dB only when <strong>purchases occur</strong></li>
        <li><code>‚ö°Ô∏édB</code> is <strong>earned, not bought</strong>, ensuring it flows through genuine engagement</li>
        <li>Token flow is <strong>tracked and monitored</strong> to prevent abuse</li>
        <li>System-wide support budgets (e.g., for Pathweavers or campaign rewards) are distributed carefully and reviewed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>NOIZ adjusts platform-wide variables such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Revenue splits</li>
        <li>Quest rewards</li>
        <li>Campaign pools</li>
        <li>Asset pricing</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The system is designed to scale and balance ‚Äî not inflate or dilute value.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="why-we-dont-call-it-a-coin">Why We Don‚Äôt Call It a Coin</h2>
      <p>To ensure <strong>clarity and legal safety</strong>, Decibels are <strong>never referred to as coins, tokens of value, or crypto</strong>.</p>
      <p>Decibels are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Not speculative assets</strong> ‚Äî their value is fixed and cannot be traded</li>
        <li><strong>Not transferable off-platform</strong> ‚Äî they remain inside NOIZ</li>
        <li><strong>Not backed by fiat or blockchain</strong> ‚Äî there is no mining, staking, or volatility</li>
        <li><strong>Not designed for resale</strong> ‚Äî they cannot be sold, exchanged, or liquidated outside of NOIZ‚Äôs internal system</li>
      </ul>
      <p>They‚Äôre best understood as <strong>platform-locked digital goods</strong> ‚Äî like Twitch Bits, Robux, or V-Bucks ‚Äî but with clearer distinction between spendable (<code>dB</code>) and earnable (<code>‚ö°Ô∏édB</code>) types.</p>

      <h2 id="key-principles">Key Principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>üîÅ <strong>No Decibel can be cashed out unless it‚Äôs charged (<code>‚ö°Ô∏édB</code>)</strong></li>
        <li>üë• <strong>No Decibel is earned without viewer or user support</strong></li>
        <li>üåê <strong>No Decibel can leave the platform</strong> ‚Äî there is no crypto bridge, no resale path, no wallet-to-wallet transfer</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This protects the platform from financial classification issues and ensures creators are rewarded for meaningful contribution ‚Äî not speculative schemes.</p>

      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
      <p><strong>Q: Can I trade Decibels with other users?</strong><br>
      A: No. Decibels cannot be transferred directly between users, and there is no trading system.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: Can Decibels ever become cryptocurrency?</strong><br>
      A: No. Decibels are not based on blockchain and are intentionally kept off-chain to avoid regulatory issues.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: Will the cost of dB change over time?</strong><br>
      A: dB pricing may adjust platform-wide based on economic needs, but the core value of <code>‚ö°Ô∏édB</code> will remain stable for creator rewards.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: What happens to unused Decibels?</strong><br>
      A: Unused dB remain in the user‚Äôs Constellation ledger until spent. They are not refundable, but they do not expire.</p>
