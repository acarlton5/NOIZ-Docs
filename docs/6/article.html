      <h2 id="why-stream-ratings-matter">Why Stream Ratings Matter</h2>
      <p>NOIZ uses stream ratings to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Help viewers make informed choices</li>
        <li>Ensure safe browsing experiences for all ages</li>
        <li>Maintain platform compliance with global content standards</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ratings also assist with stream discovery, tagging, and enforcement of community safety. Creators are responsible for correctly labeling their streams based on content, presentation, and chat dynamics.</p>
      <p>Failure to use accurate ratings may result in warnings or visibility restrictions from the platform.</p>

      <h2 id="noiz-stream-rating-categories">NOIZ Stream Rating Categories</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Everyone</dt>
        <dd>General content suitable for all ages. No mature themes, swearing, or innuendo. Safe for classrooms, family-friendly spaces, or viewers under 13.</dd>
        <dt>Teen</dt>
        <dd>Some mild language, suggestive themes, or fantasy violence. No graphic depictions, adult language, or intense imagery. Recommended for viewers 13+.</dd>
        <dt>Mature</dt>
        <dd>May contain frequent strong language, intense topics, mature attire, or suggestive content. Viewer discretion is advised. Use this tag for adult audiences or streams that explore real-world topics with complexity. Adult-themed content may fall under this category — but this does not permit pornographic, overtly sexual, or indecent content. NOIZ does not allow pornographic or explicit adult content in any form, as outlined in our Terms of Use.</dd>

      <h2 id="best-practices-for-stream-ratings">Best Practices for Stream Ratings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If in doubt, choose the higher rating to avoid issues.</li>
        <li>Use Mature rating for streams with:
          <ul>
            <li>Revealing clothing or intense flirtatious roleplay</li>
            <li>Heavy profanity or graphic storytelling</li>
            <li>Innuendo that may not be suitable for younger audiences</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Avoid baiting the rating system (e.g., labeling a stream “Everyone” while allowing mature discussion or behavior).</li>
        <li>If your chat behavior shifts during stream (e.g., lots of adult jokes or commentary), consider updating your label.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="does-rating-affect-monetization">Does Rating Affect Monetization?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No. Mature-rated streams are still eligible for all monetization tools, quests, and boosts.</li>
        <li>Some quests or sponsored campaigns may have specific maturity rating requirements.</li>
        <li>Reverb and Vibe activity are not limited by rating type.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Can I be penalized for forgetting to change my rating midstream?</dt>
        <dd>If it happens once and is quickly corrected, you’ll likely just get a system notice. Repeated mislabeling may result in enforcement review.</dd>
        <dt>Can Mature streams feature sexual themes or topics?</dt>
        <dd>Only to a suggestive or narrative degree. Nudity, sexual simulation, or pornography is never allowed, even under Mature.</dd>
        <dt>Can I change ratings on the fly?</dt>
        <dd>Yes, through your Creator Hub → Stream Settings. The system will prompt viewers with a warning when changing to Mature.</dd>
        <dt>Does rating affect visibility?</dt>
        <dd>Not by default. However, viewers can filter streams based on content level, and some tags (like “Family-Friendly”) will deprioritize Mature streams.</dd>
