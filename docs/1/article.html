  <section id="before-you-begin" class="mb-4">
    <h2 class="h4">Before You Begin</h2>
    <p>NOIZ account creation is handled through the Constellation app. Your identity is tied to your verified Constellation ID, which you then use to choose a username. You&apos;ll need a verified email and access to the Constellation app on your device.</p>

  <section id="register-new" class="mb-4">
    <h2 class="h4">Registering a New NOIZ Account</h2>
    <p>Open the NOIZ platform and choose “Register.” You&apos;ll be given a Connection Token. In your Constellation app, tap <em>Keys → Register New Platform</em>, enter the token, generate a six‑digit Handshake Code, and enter it on NOIZ to complete the secure handshake.</p>

  <section id="connect-existing" class="mb-4">
    <h2 class="h4">Connecting to an Existing NOIZ Account</h2>
    <p>If you previously registered NOIZ in Constellation, open the app and go to <em>Keys</em>. Tap NOIZ in the list, generate a six‑digit Handshake Code, and enter that code on NOIZ to authorize access.</p>

  <section id="constellation-auth" class="mb-4">
    <h2 class="h4">How Constellation Handles Authentication</h2>
    <p>Constellation replaces traditional passwords and 2FA. Authentication is encrypted and device linked. All platform access is managed through your verified Constellation identity, and you can revoke access or manage sessions from <em>Constellation → Keys → Active Connections</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h4">Verifying Your Identity (for Monetization &amp; Access Unlocks)</h2>
    <p>Identity verification helps prevent fraud and abuse and unlocks monetization features such as ⚡︎dB cashouts and marketplace listings.</p>
    <p>We ask for a valid government-issued ID and your legal name (not shown publicly). Once verified you gain access to monetization tools, marketplace listing, and creator badges.</p>
