      <h2 id="who-are-pathweavers">Who Are Pathweavers?</h2>
      <p>Pathweavers are trusted community members who run <strong>NOIZ relay nodes</strong> — specialized server instances that help:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Distribute streaming bandwidth</li>
        <li>Reduce latency for regional viewers</li>
        <li>Strengthen network resilience</li>
        <li>Offset platform infrastructure costs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>They are <strong>not</strong> miners or crypto validators — Pathweavers are rewarded for technical contribution, not speculation or computation.</p>

      <h2 id="why-the-name-pathweaver">Why the Name &quot;Pathweaver&quot;?</h2>
      <p>Streaming on NOIZ relies on custom routing — streams must find the lowest-latency, most reliable path to viewers.</p>
      <p>Pathweavers “weave the route” for content by providing pathways between:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Streamers</li>
        <li>Viewers</li>
        <li>Edge servers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Their work helps shape the technical fabric of NOIZ.</p>

      <h2 id="what-pathweavers-do">What Pathweavers Do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Host relay nodes using provided configurations</li>
        <li>✅ Maintain uptime and connectivity logs</li>
        <li>✅ Ensure privacy and compliance with NOIZ standards</li>
        <li>✅ Follow technical upgrade schedules during rollouts</li>
        <li>✅ Respect viewer trust and data integrity</li>
      </ul>
      <p>They are never exposed to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Viewer account data</li>
        <li>Chat messages</li>
        <li>Personal identity info</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All content is encrypted in transport — nodes simply relay video/audio streams between endpoints.</p>

      <h2 id="pathweaver-badge">Pathweaver Badge</h2>
      <p>Approved node operators receive the <strong>Pathweaver badge</strong>, shown:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In chat</li>
        <li>On user profiles</li>
        <li>On the public node map (optional anonymity)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It signifies major infrastructure contribution and is distinct from roles like Developer or Streamer.</p>

      <h2 id="why-host-a-relay-node">Why Host a Relay Node?</h2>
      <p>Benefits include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>⚡︎dB support bonuses from the platform’s internal support budget</li>
        <li>Priority in early test rollouts of infrastructure features</li>
        <li>Eligibility for Pathweaver milestones</li>
        <li>Recognition as a foundational member of NOIZ’s architecture</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Relay nodes draw from a <strong>fixed platform reserve</strong> — they do not “mint” or generate new value like crypto systems.</p>

      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Can anyone become a Pathweaver?</strong> → Yes — if you meet the requirements and pass screening</li>
        <li><strong>Do I earn money?</strong> → You earn ⚡︎dB support, which may be eligible for cashout under platform policy</li>
        <li><strong>Can I resell access to my node?</strong> → No — unauthorized traffic or node monetization is forbidden</li>
        <li><strong>Can I lose Pathweaver status?</strong> → Yes — for downtime, abuse, or policy violations</li>
        <li><strong>Is this crypto or mining?</strong> → No — this is stream routing, not computation or token minting</li>
