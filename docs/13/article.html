      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>The NOIZ Marketplace is a platform for creators, artists, and developers to share digital assets in exchange for support through Decibels (dB). All digital assets on NOIZ are unlocked through support contributions and are granted as non-exclusive, non-transferable licenses for in-platform use. These assets are not "purchased" in the traditional sense and no ownership is transferred.</p>

      <ul>

        <li><strong>Support-Based Licensing:</strong> Users contribute Decibels to unlock the right to use a digital asset; this is not a sale.</li>
        <li><strong>Asset Creator:</strong> The original uploader of a digital asset (emote, overlay, plugin, audio, etc.) who retains all rights unless explicitly waived.</li>
