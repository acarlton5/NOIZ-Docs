      <h2 id="what-is-echostage">What Is Echostage?</h2>
      <p>Echostage is NOIZ’s live, momentum-driven spotlight system that features high-engagement creators across the platform. Unlike legacy “front page” systems or static promotion slots, Echostage operates dynamically—rotating featured streams in real time based on interactive signals, not viewer count or status.</p>
      <p>While it draws inspiration from Mixer’s HypeZone, Echostage evaluates real-time data from Quests, Reverb, Vibes, and viewer actions to determine which streams are generating genuine engagement. It is category-, Quest-, and community-aware, meaning your content is evaluated within the context of your audience and streaming genre—not compared to unrelated creators.</p>
      <p>Featured streams appear in the Echostage carousel on the NOIZ homepage and in relevant game directories, giving creators increased visibility during moments of peak activity.</p>

      <h2 id="how-streams-get-picked">How Streams Get Picked for Echostage</h2>
      <p>Echostage selection is determined by live signals, not manual curation. Key eligibility factors include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Quest activity: Are viewers actively completing Quests, triggering boosts, or interacting with your stream’s objectives?</li>
        <li>Reverb and Vibe levels: Sudden surges in engagement through Reverb redemptions, chat activity, and Vibe usage increase Echostage consideration.</li>
        <li>Rating and content match: Your stream’s maturity label must align with platform safety expectations for the category (e.g., Mature-rated content won’t be shown to “Everyone” filtered users).</li>
        <li>Game and tag routing: Are you tagged appropriately and contributing to a trending or underrepresented tag?</li>
        <li>Boosts from viewers: Echostage isn’t pay-to-win—but viewer-initiated boosts (via dB or Reverb) are used as a signal of real interest.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="how-viewers-influence">How Viewers Influence Echostage</h2>
      <p>Viewers play a direct role in helping streams reach Echostage. Their actions can create ripple effects that the system detects and elevates. These include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Boosting streams using Decibels or Reverb</li>
        <li>Triggering Quest completions that spike activity</li>
        <li>Generating Hype Moments, like synchronized chat actions, emote flurries, or chain raids</li>
        <li>Gifting subs or supporting Quests, particularly when multiple viewers act at once</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> Boosting doesn’t guarantee Echostage—it increases your routing probability based on cumulative engagement signals.</p>

      <h2 id="what-happens-when-featured">What Happens When You’re Featured</h2>
      <p>If your stream is routed into Echostage, you’ll be surfaced prominently to users browsing NOIZ—both on the homepage and within specific game or tag hubs.</p>
      <p>When featured:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your stream will appear in the Echostage carousel</li>
        <li>Your category, game, and Quest status may be spotlighted</li>
        <li>Your chat may shift into Boost Mode—a temporary environment where emote density, overlays, or sticker reactions are more visible</li>
        <li>Platform DCT or Admin staff may silently monitor your stream to ensure your content aligns with your maturity label and category</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is no alert when you enter Echostage—the system prefers organic engagement. However, you may notice a spike in viewers, chat, or boosts.</p>

      <h2 id="increase-echostage-potential">How to Increase Your Echostage Potential</h2>
      <p>While Echostage is algorithmic, you can optimize your stream to improve your chances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use accurate and consistent stream metadata: Keep your stream title, game tag, and maturity label aligned with your actual content.</li>
        <li>Enable and promote Quests: Viewers completing Quests directly boosts your visibility metrics.</li>
        <li>Encourage interactive moments: Use emotes, chat triggers, and community calls-to-action to get your audience involved.</li>
        <li>Stream during known peak activity hours: Echostage routing is per-category and per-tag. Your odds increase when you’re live at the right moment.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="things-that-will-not-help">Things That Will NOT Help You</h2>
      <p>Attempting to “game” Echostage will not work and may flag your account. The system actively suppresses manipulation.</p>
      <p>Ineffective or harmful behaviors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Buying Decibels and boosting your own stream—self-boosts are not counted toward Echostage routing</li>
        <li>Botting or artificial viewer inflation—NOIZ tracks behavioral fingerprints and suppresses inorganic activity</li>
        <li>Inaccurate tagging—Misleading tags will prevent you from being routed</li>
        <li>Empty raids or spammed gifts—These create noise, not engagement, and will not count</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="cooldowns-and-limits">Echostage Cooldowns &amp; Limits</h2>
      <p>To maintain fairness and variety, NOIZ limits how often a stream can appear in Echostage:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Streams may only appear a limited number of times within a rolling time window (exact duration undisclosed to prevent abuse)</li>
        <li>Cooldowns reset after a period of inactivity or when the stream rotates out</li>
        <li>Boosts decay over time unless actively refreshed by ongoing viewer activity</li>
        <li>Previously featured streams are deprioritized temporarily to give other creators a chance to be seen</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Can I opt out of being featured on Echostage?</dt>
        <dd>No, Echostage is an organic visibility feature. However, setting your stream to “Hidden” or using a restricted rating may suppress routing.</dd>
        <dt>Does Echostage earn me ⚡︎dB or income?</dt>
        <dd>Echostage itself doesn’t pay. But the increased exposure often leads to more viewer support, which can convert into ⚡︎dB if you’re eligible.</dd>
        <dt>Why did I appear briefly and then disappear?</dt>
        <dd>You may have spiked momentarily but dropped below the active engagement threshold. Boosts and activity must be sustained.</dd>
        <dt>Can Partner+ creators override the algorithm?</dt>
        <dd>No. Partner+ creators may have higher weighting for eligibility, but all Echostage routing is based on real-time platform data.</dd>
