      <h2 id="who-can-create">Who Can Create on NOIZ?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Anyone with a verified NOIZ account can start broadcasting ‚Äî no exclusivity, contracts, or application necessary</li>
        <li>There is no invite system</li>
        <li>You do not need to be earning-eligible to go live</li>
        <li>Verification and legal compliance are the only requirements</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="progression">What Counts as Progression on NOIZ?</h2>
      <p>NOIZ uses a tiered progression system to recognize creator impact and consistency. Each level comes with perks ‚Äî most importantly, improved revenue splits and access to tools.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Streaming frequency and reliability</li>
        <li>Viewer interaction (Vibe, Reverb, Quests)</li>
        <li>Engagement through chat, boosts, quests</li>
        <li>Milestones like time streamed and community retention</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Your Level and Tier are assigned automatically when you meet the required platform and legal criteria ‚Äî no application needed</strong></p>

      <h2 id="milestones">Creator Milestones &amp; Level System</h2>
      <p>Each level unlocks a new revenue split and platform access:</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Tier</th><th>Badge</th><th>Revenue Split</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>üü¢ Verified</td><td>‚úÖ</td><td>50%</td></tr>
          <tr><td>üü† Affiliate</td><td>üü†</td><td>60%</td></tr>
          <tr><td>üîµ Partner</td><td>üîµ</td><td>70%</td></tr>
          <tr><td>üü£ Partner+</td><td>üü£</td><td>80%</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <ul>
        <li>Verified = Platform recognition</li>
        <li>Affiliate = First earning-eligible level</li>
        <li>Partner = High-consistency creators</li>
        <li>Partner+ = Top contributors or community-driven impact</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="monetization">Monetization vs Badge Progression</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Any verified user who completes legal onboarding can begin earning ‚ö°Ô∏édB through viewer support</li>
        <li>You cannot withdraw ‚ö°Ô∏édB until Affiliate (legal requirements met)</li>
        <li>Affiliate and higher badges increase your revenue split</li>
        <li>Badges signal status, not restrict access ‚Äî creators are never "locked out" of tools if they meet requirements</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="perks">What Are Creator Perks Based On?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Viewer interaction (Vibe, Reverb, Quest completions)</li>
        <li>‚ö°Ô∏édB and faded dB received</li>
        <li>Stream frequency and uptime</li>
        <li>Marketplace listings, plugin use, and participation in platform tools</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="time-based">Time-Based &amp; Support Milestones</h2>
      <p>NOIZ celebrates long-term community support with unique badge unlocks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Loyalty badge stages (1m, 3m, 6m, 1y, 2y, 5y‚Ä¶)</li>
        <li>Gifted sub milestones (5, 10, 25, 50‚Ä¶ 5,000)</li>
        <li>Vibe badges earned only in your own channel (100 Vibe ‚Üí 1M+)</li>
        <li>Support actions (subs, boosts, quests) directly affect your progress toward new levels</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="measurement">How Progression Is Measured (Safely)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>NOIZ displays your viewer count, but it does not factor into level progression</li>
        <li>There is no public follower count</li>
        <li>Botting viewership has no reward ‚Äî we don‚Äôt use it for visibility or tier unlocks</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Progression is calculated internally through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stream frequency and uptime</li>
        <li>Viewer interaction (chat, quests, emotes)</li>
        <li>‚ö°Ô∏édB earned from other users</li>
        <li>Quest activity and Marketplace use</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This ensures that growth is earned through community interaction, not vanity metrics.</p>

      <h2 id="level-duration">Level Duration and Reset</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your creator level resets annually based on your previous year's performance.</li>
        <li>You retain the perks of your previous highest level for the full current year</li>
        <li>This ensures active creators are prioritized in rewards and visibility</li>
        <li>Inactive creators will still have access to their tools, but level displays will adjust accordingly</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="faq">FAQ &amp; Transparency</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Can I apply for Partner manually?<br>No. All levels are assigned automatically once criteria are met.</li>
        <li>Can I lose Affiliate or Partner status?<br>You won't be downgraded for inactivity, but annual resets mean perks follow your engagement.</li>
        <li>Can I hide my badge progression?<br>You can customize which badge displays in your chat, but system progression is tracked internally.</li>
        <li>Do badges affect stream visibility?<br>They may affect Echostage or Quest routing ‚Äî not standard search or platform placement.</li>
      </ul>
