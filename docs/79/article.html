        <p>This guide explains how artists earn, track, and withdraw ⚡︎dB from their creations on NOIZ while keeping everything framed as virtual goods.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2 id="1-how-artists-earn-on-noiz">1. How Artists Earn on NOIZ</h2>
      <p>Artists can earn ⚡︎dB through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Viewer unlocks of assets (emotes, overlays, audio, etc.)</li>
        <li>Commissions (when enabled for Verified Artists)</li>
        <li>Sponsored placement allocations (e.g. for featured asset packs)</li>
        <li>Quest integrations (e.g. viewers unlock your work through campaigns)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>⚡︎dB is NOIZ’s <strong>charged virtual token</strong> — similar to Twitch Bits — and must be earned through platform engagement, not purchased directly for payout.</p>
      <h2 id="2-unlock-based-earnings">2. Unlock-Based Earnings</h2>
      <p>Each listing you publish can be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unlocked by viewers for ⚡︎dB (you set the unlock amount)</li>
        <li>Offered as a Quest reward (NOIZ sets terms and handles reward fulfillment)</li>
        <li>Included in promotional bundles (with shared ⚡︎dB allocation)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You’ll receive:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A <strong>platform allocation</strong> of ⚡︎dB from each viewer unlock of your listing</li>
        <li>The ⚡︎dB allocation percentage varies based on your Artist Tier (Creator / Verified / Featured)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>⚠️ <strong>Faded</strong> (non-cashable) dB cannot be earned through Marketplace unlocks.</p>
      <h2 id="3-commission-earnings-verified-only">3. Commission Earnings (Verified Only)</h2>
      <p>Verified Artists can accept:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>⚡︎dB commissions from streamers or viewers</li>
        <li>Marketplace-bound commissions (delivered as unlockables)</li>
        <li>Private or public commissions (you choose listing visibility)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>⚠️ All commissions must remain <strong>digital-only</strong> — no off-platform transactions or physical goods are allowed.</p>
      <h2 id="4-viewing-and-managing-earnings">4. Viewing and Managing Earnings</h2>
      <p>Your Artist ⚡︎dB allocations can be tracked from:<br><strong>Dashboard → Artist Hub → ⚡︎dB Earnings</strong></p>
      <p>There you can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>View ⚡︎dB allocations by listing</li>
        <li>See unlock logs (anonymized viewer IDs)</li>
        <li>Break down ⚡︎dB by listing, bundle, or event</li>
        <li>Export logs for recordkeeping or support</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="5-cashing-out">5. Cashing Out</h2>
      <p>Only <strong>charged ⚡︎dB</strong> (earned through viewer interaction, not purchases) can be cashed out.</p>
      <p>To initiate a withdrawal:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Accumulate at least <strong>10,000 ⚡︎dB</strong> (≈ $100 USD equivalent)</li>
        <li>Open:<br><strong>My Loot → ⚡︎dB → Cashout</strong></li>
        <li>Select payout method (regional options will vary)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>⚠️ Marketplace ⚡︎dB is eligible for cashout as long as it comes from verified platform activity (not refunded, looped, or internally boosted).</p>
      <h2 id="6-using-earnings-on-platform">6. Using Earnings On-Platform</h2>
      <p>⚡︎dB earned from your work can also be used to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Support other creators</li>
        <li>Unlock premium plugins or overlays</li>
        <li>Participate in Quests</li>
        <li>Access Marketplace items</li>
        <li>Gift subs and boost stream visibility</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Artists are not required to cash out — <strong>reinvesting your ⚡︎dB</strong> within the platform is fully supported.</p>
      <h2 id="7-payout-schedule">7. Payout Schedule</h2>
      <p>Artist ⚡︎dB follows the standard cashout cycle:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Monthly review period for integrity checks</li>
        <li>Net-30 payout window (after request is approved)</li>
        <li>Payouts may be delayed if flagged for Quest abuse, duplicate listings, or suspicious unlock activity</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="8-faq">8. FAQ</h2>
