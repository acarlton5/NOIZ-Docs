      <h2 id="core-philosophy">NOIZ’s Core Philosophy: No Ads, No Interruptions</h2>
      <p>NOIZ does not run:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pre-rolls or mid-roll ads</li>
        <li>Banner placements or clickable pop-ups</li>
        <li>Audio or video ads injected by third-party networks</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We believe that creator spaces should belong to the creator, not be hijacked by outside interests. On NOIZ, viewer attention is treated as a relationship, not an opportunity to sell impressions.</p>
      <p>Your stream is not an ad break — it's your space.</p>

      <h2 id="earn">How Creators Earn Without Ads</h2>
      <p>NOIZ empowers creators through a support-based rewards system, not advertiser payouts.</p>
      <p>Ways creators earn:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Subscriptions — 500 dB (viewer-funded virtual support)</li>
        <li>Tips and boosts — sent using dB and ⚡︎dB</li>
        <li>Quest participation — creators may receive ⚡︎dB for viewer completions</li>
        <li>Sponsored campaign quests — opt-in, brand-backed quests that reward viewers and creators</li>
        <li>No creator needs to hit view count targets or serve ads to unlock rewards.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="sponsored-quests">Sponsored Quests = Our Version of “Brand Deals”</h2>
      <p>NOIZ uses sponsored quests as an ethical, engagement-first way to integrate brand content.</p>
      <p>What they are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Optional Quests backed by brands or games</li>
        <li>Viewers complete goals (e.g., "watch 15 minutes of a tagged stream")</li>
        <li>Rewards include:
          <ul>
            <li>Cosmetic badges</li>
            <li>dB</li>
            <li>Stream-specific effects or unlockables</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>All sponsored quests are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Approved and reviewed by NOIZ staff</li>
        <li>Clearly labeled with “Sponsored” tags</li>
        <li>Built into the platform — no external signups or requirements</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These quests replace ad banners with something interactive and rewarding.</p>

      <h2 id="why-rejected-ads">Why We Rejected Ads Entirely</h2>
      <p>Here’s why we intentionally chose to exclude ads:</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Problem With Ad-Based Platforms</th><th>NOIZ’s Response</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>Viewers forced to watch irrelevant ads</td><td>No pre-rolls, no interruptions</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Advertisers set the rules</td><td>Creators retain control</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Metrics focused on time watched, not interaction</td><td>Boosts, quests, and chat engagement drive visibility</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Cookie tracking and third-party surveillance</td><td>NOIZ does not use ad-tracking or sell data</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>NOIZ was built for creators — not for squeezing revenue from passive watch time.</p>

      <h2 id="ethical-sponsors">How Sponsored Content Stays Ethical</h2>
      <p>We don’t just allow sponsored quests — we hold them to clear standards:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All sponsored content must be tagged in-stream and in Quest UI</li>
        <li>Rewards are always platform-native (dB, ⚡︎dB, badges — not fiat or off-site perks)</li>
        <li>No misleading incentives or forced shoutouts</li>
        <li>There is no pay-to-feature path — Echostage and visibility are earned through boosts and participation</li>
        <li>Sponsored quests should feel fun, not forced.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="viewer-benefits">How This Benefits Viewers</h2>
      <p>For the audience, this means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Immediate stream access — no waiting rooms or unskippable ads</li>
        <li>No trackers, cookies, or off-platform popups</li>
        <li>Viewer support goes directly to creators, not intermediaries</li>
        <li>Interactive opportunities — quests, badges, boosts — replace passive viewing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The result? A cleaner, more meaningful experience for everyone.</p>

      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
