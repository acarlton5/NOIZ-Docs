        <p>NOIZ allows creators to simulcast their streams to other platforms — as long as core engagement, visibility, and plugin systems remain respected.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="1-what-is-dual-streaming">1. What Is Dual Streaming?</h2>
      <p><strong>Dual streaming</strong> (or simulcasting) means broadcasting the <strong>same live content</strong> on NOIZ and other platforms at the same time — such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Twitch</li>
        <li>YouTube</li>
        <li>Kick</li>
        <li>Facebook Live</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This guide outlines how dual streaming works <strong>within NOIZ’s creator rules</strong>, and what actions may violate campaign or moderation policies.</p>

      <h2 id="2-is-dual-streaming-allowed-on-noiz">2. Is Dual Streaming Allowed on NOIZ?</h2>
      <p>✅ <strong>Yes</strong> — NOIZ supports simulcasting by default.</p>
      <p>We believe creators should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Grow across multiple platforms</li>
        <li>Reach broader audiences</li>
        <li>Retain ownership of their content and discoverability</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are <strong>no exclusivity clauses</strong> required to stream on NOIZ.</p>

      <h2 id="3-whats-not-allowed">3. What’s Not Allowed</h2>
      <p>❌ Dual streaming becomes a violation if you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertise other platforms mid-stream</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Example: “Come to Twitch for drops” or “Going live on YouTube now instead”</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Use NOIZ as a redirect tool only</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>i.e., passive camera with no engagement, zero chat presence, or clear intent to bounce users elsewhere</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Neglect NOIZ chat or viewers</strong> during streams — especially if:
          <ul>
            <li>You’re running Quests that require viewer interaction</li>
            <li>You ignore Quest overlay events, plugin triggers, or Decibel support</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Break Quest campaign terms</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>If a Sponsored Quest specifies “NOIZ-first” or “exclusive stream window,” you must follow those terms</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Auto-redirect NOIZ users</strong> through overlays, commands, or pinned links</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="4-acceptable-use-cases">4. Acceptable Use Cases</h2>
      <p>✅ Dual streaming is fully permitted when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You actively participate in <strong>both chats</strong>, or have mods supporting each</li>
        <li>Your <strong>content is the same</strong> across platforms — not favoring one with perks or interactivity</li>
        <li>You <strong>don’t give extra benefits</strong> (drops, unlocks, giveaways) to non-NOIZ platforms</li>
        <li>You <strong>don’t embed other chat overlays</strong> that drown out NOIZ visuals or plugin visibility</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your viewers feel like the NOIZ experience is “lesser” than other platforms, you may be asked to adjust.</p>

      <h2 id="5-tool-support">5. Tool Support</h2>
      <p>NOIZ supports all major dual-streaming setups:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🧩 <strong>NOIZ Studio</strong> + third-party restream services (e.g., Restream.io, Castr)</li>
        <li>🎥 <strong>OBS Studio</strong> with multi-RTMP plugin</li>
        <li>🛰️ <strong>Pathweaver relays</strong> that forward streams from custom nodes</li>
        <li>⚙️ Other tools that treat NOIZ as an equal destination — not a backup or mirror</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Avoid setups that down-prioritize NOIZ performance or overlay accuracy.</p>

      <h2 id="6-important-notes-for-sponsored-quests">6. Important Notes for Sponsored Quests</h2>
      <p>If you're participating in a <strong>Sponsored Quest</strong> or verified <strong>Partner Campaign</strong>, always check the terms.</p>
      <p>🚫 If the campaign includes an exclusivity clause or “NOIZ-first” rule, you must:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prioritize <strong>NOIZ chat and viewer interaction</strong></li>
        <li>Avoid linking or promoting your other stream locations during the quest</li>
        <li>Keep your <strong>Quest overlays, plugins, or triggers active and visible</strong></li>
        <li>Maintain stream focus on the NOIZ experience</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Violation of these rules can result in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>⚠️ Quest progress reset</li>
        <li>❌ ⚡︎dB being withheld</li>
        <li>🚫 Future campaign access removed</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="7-faq">7. FAQ</h2>
      <p><strong>Can I simulcast if I’m not in a campaign?</strong><br>→ Yes, as long as you follow platform behavior standards.</p>
      <p><strong>Can I run a sub or view goal tied to Twitch?</strong><br>→ No. Don’t display goals, incentives, or pinned messages that are exclusive to other platforms during a NOIZ stream.</p>
      <p><strong>Can I send people to my YouTube VODs or Twitch clips?</strong><br>→ Yes — off-stream linking is fine. But <strong>don’t tell viewers to leave NOIZ for another live broadcast</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>Can I embed my Twitch chat on stream?</strong><br>→ Not recommended. It creates priority conflict and may interfere with NOIZ’s moderation and plugin overlays.</p>
