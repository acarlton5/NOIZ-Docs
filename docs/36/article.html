      <h2 id="what-counts-as-mature-content">1. What Counts as Mature Content</h2>
      <p>Mature content refers to any stream element that may not be appropriate for all audiences, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Profanity, vulgar language, or graphic jokes</li>
        <li>Explicit or heavy thematic content (e.g. sex, trauma, violence, gore)</li>
        <li>Depictions or discussion of alcohol, drugs, or tobacco</li>
        <li>Mature-rated games with blood, horror, or suggestive content</li>
        <li>Innuendo or lewd humor (without being sexually explicit)</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Mature does not mean adult entertainment.</strong> Content should still serve a creative, narrative, or expressive purpose — not exist solely for shock or sexual provocation.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="what-s-allowed-with-a-mature-label">2. What’s Allowed with a Mature Label</h2>
      <p>You may stream the following, if properly labeled:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Games rated <strong>Mature</strong> or <strong>18+</strong>, including horror, FPS, or survival titles</li>
        <li>IRL conversations involving adult themes or lived experience (e.g., relationships, nightlife, trauma)</li>
        <li>Casual use of swearing, crude jokes, or adult-oriented humor</li>
        <li>References to drinking, smoking, or partying in a storytelling context</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your stream includes any of the above, you must use:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>"Mature" tag</strong></li>
        <li>A stream rating of <strong>M</strong> or <strong>18+</strong></li>
        <li>Let NOIZ’s <strong>auto age-gating</strong> apply</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Tags and ratings are not optional — they’re required for both viewer safety and legal compliance.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="what-is-not-allowed-even-with-a-mature-tag">3. What Is Not Allowed — Even With a Mature Tag</h2>
      <p>The following are strictly prohibited, regardless of maturity rating or stream context:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pornographic content (live, pre-recorded, or animated)</li>
        <li>Nudity, sexual activity, or simulation of sexual acts</li>
        <li>Depictions of minors in any sexual or suggestive context (zero tolerance)</li>
        <li>Real-world violence (e.g., fights, injury stunts, accidents)</li>
        <li>Promotion of illegal behavior (e.g., drug use on camera, reckless dares)</li>
        <li>Streams whose primary focus is sexual content or titillation</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>NOIZ is not an adult content platform.</strong> Mature tags are for thematic or expressive context — not a license to break ToS.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>NOIZ recognizes that context matters — but intent and tone are also reviewed during moderation.</p>

      <h2 id="creator-responsibilities">5. Creator Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>As a creator, you are responsible for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Applying the correct stream rating and mature tags before going live</li>
        <li>Updating the tags if your stream changes tone or content mid-session</li>
        <li>Using overlays or chat descriptions to clarify what viewers can expect</li>
        <li>Moderating your chat to prevent viewer behavior from becoming inappropriate or harassing</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Mature doesn’t mean “anything goes.” Respectful boundaries still apply — for both the content and the community around it.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="viewer-protections">6. Viewer Protections</h2>
      <p>Mature content is automatically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Age-gated</strong> using Constellation-linked birthdate</li>
        <li><strong>Hidden</strong> from underage viewers and searchable filters (based on settings)</li>
        <li><strong>Flagged</strong> with a “Mature Content” warning before the stream can be entered</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Viewers can also:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Disable all mature stream visibility in their Settings</li>
        <li>Report miscategorized streams that appear to bypass content policies</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p>If a stream isn’t properly tagged, you can help keep the platform safe by reporting it.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="violations-and-enforcement">7. Violations and Enforcement</h2>

        <li>Content flagging and visibility restrictions</li>
        <li>Warnings or temporary suspension for misleading tags or misratings</li>
        <li>Immediate ban and Staff Admin escalation for sexual exploitation, predatory behavior, or repeat violations</li>

        <li>Flag channels for maturity non-compliance</li>
        <li>Enforce stricter controls for repeat offenders</li>
      </ul>
