      <h2 id="why-this-policy-exists">1. Why This Policy Exists</h2>
      <p>Gambling and sweepstakes laws vary dramatically across countries, states, and even cities. As a global platform, NOIZ is responsible for preventing creators from unintentionally breaking local laws or running programs that may put them ‚Äî or the platform ‚Äî at risk.</p>
      <p>This policy exists to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prevent unlawful or misleading giveaways and contests</li>
        <li>Ensure creators do not accidentally engage in regulated gambling activity</li>
        <li>Maintain platform-wide fairness and transparency</li>
        <li>Protect viewers from coercive or pay-to-win reward systems</li>
      </ul>
      <p>NOIZ prohibits real-money gambling and places strict conditions around anything resembling games of chance.</p>

      <p><strong>Gambling</strong>, for the purpose of this policy, is defined as:</p>
