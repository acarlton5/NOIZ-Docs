      <h2 id="why-kyc-is-required">Why KYC Is Required</h2>
      <p>To ensure compliance with financial regulations and to protect the platform from fraud, <strong>NOIZ requires identity verification (KYC ‚Äì Know Your Customer)</strong> before any payouts can be processed.</p>
      <p>KYC helps verify:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your <strong>legal identity</strong></li>
        <li>Your <strong>country of residence</strong> and regional eligibility</li>
        <li>Your <strong>age</strong> (minimum age varies by region)</li>
        <li>Your <strong>right to receive virtual token-based rewards</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p>This verification is only required for <strong>creators requesting payouts</strong> ‚Äî not viewers, casual users, or creators who haven‚Äôt yet opted into monetization tools.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="who-needs-to-complete-kyc">Who Needs to Complete KYC</h2>
      <p>You must complete KYC if you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have reached <strong>Affiliate</strong> level or higher</li>
        <li>Are holding <strong>10,000 or more ‚ö°Ô∏édB</strong></li>
        <li>Are attempting to access the <strong>cashout request menu</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can continue earning ‚ö°Ô∏édB without completing KYC, but you <strong>cannot redeem or withdraw</strong> them until verification is approved.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Even if you‚Äôve been supported or gifted Decibels by viewers, they remain ineligible for cashout until the legal process is completed.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="what-kyc-collects">What KYC Collects</h2>
      <p>KYC is handled securely by our licensed verification provider. You will be asked to submit:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Full legal name</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Date of birth</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Country of residence</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Government-issued photo ID</strong></li>
        <li>Optionally: <strong>business or tax ID</strong> (for specific regions or higher earning tiers)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>NOIZ does not handle this data directly ‚Äî it is processed and verified by a third-party service bound by international privacy laws.</p>

      <h2 id="where-to-complete-kyc">Where to Complete KYC</h2>
      <p>KYC is completed through the <strong>Constellation app</strong>, which manages all account-level authorization and identity verification.</p>
      <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the <strong>Constellation app</strong></li>
        <li>Navigate to: <strong>Earnings ‚Üí ‚ö°Ô∏édB ‚Üí Payout</strong></li>
        <li>Follow the instructions to submit your documents securely</li>
        <li>You will receive email or app-based confirmation within <strong>3‚Äì5 business days</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Your payout dashboard will remain locked until verification is completed.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="how-your-data-is-used">How Your Data Is Used</h2>
      <p>Your personal data is used <strong>only</strong> for the purpose of identity and compliance verification.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>üîê <strong>Encrypted at rest</strong> and in transit</li>
        <li>üîí Stored <strong>only</strong> by our payout provider</li>
        <li>‚ùå <strong>Never shared</strong> with advertisers, partners, or public-facing tools</li>
        <li>‚úÖ Compliant with international privacy standards like GDPR and CCPA</li>
      </ul>
      <p>NOIZ will never use your KYC data for marketing, ranking, or public display.</p>

      <h2 id="legal-framing-of-monetization">Legal Framing of Monetization</h2>
      <p>All monetization on NOIZ is based on <strong>support-based digital recognition</strong>, not employment or contract work.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>‚ö°Ô∏édB = <strong>virtual tokens earned through platform activity</strong>, not wages</li>
        <li>NOIZ creators are <strong>not employees or contractors</strong></li>
        <li>There is <strong>no guaranteed income</strong>, offer of employment, or fixed rate</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This framework ensures NOIZ remains legally compliant with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Virtual currency regulations</li>
        <li>Digital platform labor classifications</li>
        <li>Global tax frameworks and digital service laws</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="what-happens-without-kyc">What Happens Without KYC</h2>
      <p>If you choose not to complete KYC, you can still:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stream and build a community</li>
        <li>Earn and accumulate ‚ö°Ô∏édB from viewer support</li>
        <li>Participate in quests, receive boosts, and be featured</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But you will <strong>not</strong> be able to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access the cashout dashboard</li>
        <li>Submit withdrawal requests</li>
        <li>Unlock monetized Marketplace listings</li>
        <li>Participate in some partner or sponsored programs</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Your ‚ö°Ô∏édB will remain stored in your account</strong>, but will not be redeemable until you complete verification.</p>
