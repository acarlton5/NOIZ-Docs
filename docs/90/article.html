      <h2 id="what-this-code-covers">What This Code Covers</h2>
      <p>This policy defines:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Behavioral expectations for relay operators (Pathweavers)</li>
        <li>Ethical and compliant use of node access</li>
        <li>Platform boundaries for communication, branding, and public representation</li>
        <li>Terms under which relays may be adjusted, suspended, or rewarded</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Hosting a NOIZ relay node is a <strong>privilege granted under operational policy</strong>, not an automatic right. This code exists to protect the reliability and trust of NOIZ’s streaming infrastructure.</p>

      <h2 id="expected-conduct">Expected Conduct</h2>
      <p>As a Pathweaver and relay host, you agree to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Operate your node with stability, uptime, and security as priorities</li>
        <li>Maintain respectful, constructive communication with NOIZ staff and other hosts</li>
        <li>Avoid misrepresenting your relay as “official” or “staff-run” unless explicitly invited to do so</li>
        <li>Follow the published technical documentation exactly — no modified binaries or unsupported configs</li>
        <li>Respond promptly to moderation or performance concerns flagged in your dashboard</li>
        <li>Remember that your relay directly impacts viewer and streamer experience</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="unacceptable-behavior">Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
      <p>Relay operators may be suspended or blacklisted for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hosting unstable or intentionally degraded relays</li>
        <li>Selling, renting, or offering “priority routing” to any third party</li>
        <li>Manipulating payloads or routing to redirect viewers to off-platform services</li>
        <li>Harassing other operators, streamers, or NOIZ staff</li>
        <li>Spamming chats, Discord servers, or streams while displaying a Pathweaver badge</li>
        <li>Misrepresenting ⚡︎dB rewards as guaranteed income or threatening platform escalation over allocations</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="node-identity-branding-rules">Node Identity &amp; Branding Rules</h2>
      <p><strong>Allowed:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assigning a public relay name (e.g., <em>SoCal Node – ghostrelay</em>)</li>
        <li>Appearing on the Public Node Map (opt-in)</li>
        <li>Displaying your Pathweaver badge in chat and on your profile</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Not Allowed:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using NOIZ logos in relay-host branding without approval</li>
        <li>Claiming to be a NOIZ-operated or NOIZ-staff relay</li>
        <li>Creating social accounts that imply official representation of the NOIZ relay network</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="rewards-are-performance-based">Rewards Are Performance-Based</h2>
      <p>Relay support in ⚡︎dB is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allocated at NOIZ’s discretion based on performance metrics, uptime, and regional impact</li>
        <li>Subject to change without notice for budget adjustments, routing changes, or abuse prevention</li>
        <li>Calculated through internal systems, <strong>not</strong> negotiable on request</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Attempts to falsify traffic, pressure staff for payout, or threaten escalation will result in immediate blacklisting.</p>

      <h2 id="accountability-trust">Accountability &amp; Trust</h2>
      <p>Your conduct as a Pathweaver reflects on the platform:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assist other hosts when possible</li>
        <li>Report bugs, exploits, or abuse via the dashboard — not public channels</li>
        <li>Maintain a clean, current configuration</li>
        <li>Avoid becoming a routing bottleneck or security risk</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Multiple minor violations over time may still result in loss of Pathweaver eligibility.</p>

      <h2 id="termination-clause">Termination Clause</h2>
      <p>NOIZ reserves the right to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Suspend or permanently remove a node from routing</li>
        <li>Withhold rewards for fraudulent, abusive, or non-performing relays</li>
        <li>Cease communication with hosts engaging in harassment, spam, or disruption</li>
        <li>Update this Code at any time, with notice provided in your dashboard</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Can I advertise my relay?</strong> → Yes, as long as it’s neutral and does not imply staff affiliation.</li>
        <li><strong>Can I appeal a suspension?</strong> → Yes, via the Node Dashboard, unless marked permanent.</li>
        <li><strong>Can I run my relay under a company name?</strong> → Only if pre-approved and not branded as “NOIZ.”</li>
        <li><strong>Can I keep my Pathweaver badge if I’m blacklisted?</strong> → No — badges are revoked automatically when a node is removed from the program.</li>
      </ul>
