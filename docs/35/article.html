      <h2 id="why-regional-compliance-matters">1. Why Regional Compliance Matters</h2>
      <p>NOIZ is a global platform — but <strong>streamers and viewers are still subject to local laws</strong>, regardless of platform features or moderation rules.</p>
      <p>Depending on your country or region, the following may be restricted or regulated:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What can be said or shown during a broadcast</li>
        <li>Which topics are considered politically or socially sensitive</li>
        <li>How user data is collected, stored, or transmitted</li>
        <li>Whether games or mechanics (like loot boxes or gacha pulls) are considered gambling</li>
        <li>What age limits apply to creators or viewers</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Streaming laws differ globally — and as a creator, <strong>you are responsible for following your region’s rules</strong>, even if they conflict with what’s allowed elsewhere on NOIZ.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="general-platform-rule">2. General Platform Rule</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>NOIZ does not override your local laws.</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>If your stream <strong>violates laws in your country or region</strong>, you may be restricted, muted, or removed — even if the content is acceptable under NOIZ’s Terms of Service.</p>
      <p>This applies to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Game content and visual assets</li>
        <li>On-stream behavior and speech</li>
        <li>Plugin usage and data collection</li>
        <li>Marketplace sales and token-related activity</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="age-ratings-maturity-controls">4. Age Ratings &amp; Maturity Controls</h2>
      <p>To help streamers remain compliant with local age-restriction rules, NOIZ supports:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stream rating tags</strong> (Everyone, Teen, Mature, 18+)</li>
        <li><strong>Entry warnings</strong> for flagged streams</li>
        <li><strong>Auto-restriction by region</strong> if a game, tag, or plugin is not allowed in your location</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p>You must accurately rate your own stream based on the content and the region you're streaming from.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In some countries, misrating a Mature or 18+ stream may result in a <strong>personal legal fine or criminal charge</strong> — not just platform action.</p>

      <h2 id="plugins-and-extensions">5. Plugins and Extensions</h2>
      <p>Plugins that interact with viewer data, create interactive overlays, or connect to third-party tools may have <strong>region-specific restrictions</strong>.</p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Minors' data protection laws</strong> may ban plugins that collect usernames or age data</li>
        <li><strong>Data localization laws</strong> may require info to stay within national borders</li>
        <li><strong>Tracking or profiling tools</strong> may be prohibited under EU or South American laws</li>
      </ul>
      <p>NOIZ will <strong>automatically geo-restrict</strong> plugins that fail compliance checks and <strong>label affected features</strong> in the Marketplace.</p>

        <p>NOIZ never sells personal data, and does not track off-platform behavior.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>All token data, chat messages, or viewer metrics are stored using <strong>AES-256 encryption</strong> and confined to <strong>platform-internal systems</strong>.</p>

      <h2 id="gambling-gacha-and-lootbox-content">7. Gambling, Gacha, and Lootbox Content</h2>
      <p>Certain regions classify <strong>in-game mechanics</strong> like loot boxes, skin pulls, or spin-based gacha rolls as gambling. If your stream contains this:</p>
      <p>✅ You must:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the <strong>“Game of Chance”</strong> stream tag</li>
        <li>Rate your stream accordingly (e.g., Mature, 18+)</li>
        <li>Comply with Quest restrictions for sponsored content</li>
      </ul>
      <p>❌ You cannot:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Promote gambling mechanics to minors</li>
        <li>Offer Decibel rewards for viewer bets or spins</li>
        <li>Run untagged casino-style streams in restricted regions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Failure to follow this policy may result in <strong>region-specific muting or platform removal</strong>.</p>

      <h2 id="what-happens-if-you-break-a-regional-law-while-streaming">8. What Happens If You Break a Regional Law While Streaming?</h2>
      <p>If your stream violates local laws:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>NOIZ may remove your content or limit its visibility in your country</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Your VOD may be muted, clipped, or archived privately</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Your channel may be flagged for legal risk or escalation</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may still be held <strong>personally accountable by your government</strong>, especially in regions where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Game content is regulated (e.g. South Korea, Germany)</li>
        <li>IRL streaming is considered surveillance (e.g. Japan)</li>
        <li>Unlicensed monetization is penalized (e.g. some parts of the EU)</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p>NOIZ cannot provide legal protection or override government action. You are streaming <strong>at your own legal risk</strong>.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="faq">9. FAQ</h2>
      <p><strong>Can I stream an M-rated game in a country that bans it?</strong><br>Not if your country prohibits it. You may be region-muted or account-flagged if detected.</p>
      <p><strong>What if a plugin I use isn’t allowed in my country?</strong><br>It will be blocked automatically. You’ll see a warning in your dashboard.</p>
      <p><strong>Am I protected by NOIZ if local law disagrees with me?</strong><br>No. NOIZ follows a compliance model — it cannot protect you from local authorities.</p>
      <p><strong>How do I restrict my stream visibility by region?</strong><br>Go to: <code>Settings → Stream Privacy → Regional Restrictions</code><br>Set visibility filters by country or language to comply with your local laws.</p>
