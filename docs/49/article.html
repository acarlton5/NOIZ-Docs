      <h2 id="how-to-interact-with-dct-staff-and-how-not-to">How to Interact with DCT Staff (and How Not To)</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The DCT (Dissonance Compliance Team) handles escalated moderation cases involving serious violations. To keep reviews fair, professional, and safe for all parties, this policy outlines how to communicate with DCT staff — and what behavior may result in your appeal being voided or escalated.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="why-this-exists">1. Why This Exists</h2>
      <p>The DCT oversees platform-wide enforcement for high-risk issues, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Harassment and threats</li>
        <li>Child safety and impersonation</li>
        <li>Exploitative behavior</li>
        <li>Appeals and moderation escalations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Because of the sensitivity of these cases, <strong>all communication with the DCT must be</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clear</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Respectful</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Focused on evidence and rules — not personal emotion</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="appropriate-ways-to-engage-the-dct">2. Appropriate Ways to Engage the DCT</h2>
      <p>✅ You <strong>may</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reply to system messages with <strong>new or clarifying evidence</strong></li>
        <li>Use the <strong>Account Actions → Response</strong> feature to follow up</li>
        <li>Ask <strong>specific</strong> questions about your case or next steps</li>
        <li>Request an escalation to a Staff Admin (<strong>one per case</strong>)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>📌 Treat DCT responses like support tickets — professional, structured, and evidence-based.</p>

      <h2 id="what-not-to-do">3. What NOT To Do</h2>
      <p>🚫 Never:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Insult, harass, or threaten</strong> DCT members</li>
        <li>Try to “debate” your case in public streams or chats</li>
        <li>Submit <strong>multiple appeals</strong> without new information</li>
        <li>Lie, misrepresent, or omit key context (logs are archived)</li>
        <li>Encourage <strong>mass reporting</strong>, raid behavior, or callouts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>⚠️ Examples of behavior that <strong>will void your appeal or escalate your case</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Y’all are corrupt trash mods.”</li>
        <li>“Unban me or I’ll just make alts.”</li>
        <li>“There’s no proof!” (when logs show clear violations)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="limits-of-what-dct-can-do">4. Limits of What DCT Can Do</h2>
      <p>DCT staff <strong>cannot</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reverse a <strong>streamer’s personal channel ban</strong></li>
        <li>Overturn a <strong>Staff Admin ruling</strong> without new information</li>
        <li>Moderate outside platforms (e.g. Discord, X, TikTok)</li>
        <li>Force creators to take moderation actions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Their scope is <strong>platform safety and compliance</strong> — not personal disputes.</p>

      <h2 id="escalation-rights">5. Escalation Rights</h2>
      <p>If you believe a moderation decision was:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Based on <strong>incomplete or misleading context</strong></li>
        <li>The result of a <strong>false or coordinated report</strong></li>
        <li>Misapplied to your situation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>→ You may <strong>request a Staff Admin escalation</strong> through the Appeals interface.</p>
      <p>This ensures your case is reviewed by a <strong>senior compliance reviewer</strong> with legal training.<br>It does <strong>not</strong> guarantee reversal — but it guarantees <strong>a second review.</strong></p>

      <h2 id="respect-goes-both-ways">6. Respect Goes Both Ways</h2>
      <p>All DCT members must:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Act professionally — no sarcasm, mockery, or retaliation</li>
        <li>Declare conflicts of interest</li>
        <li>Escalate sensitive or edge cases when needed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>🛡️ If you believe a DCT member acted inappropriately, you may file a <strong>Staff Conduct Report</strong> in your NOIZ inbox. These are reviewed <strong>by Staff Admin</strong>, not the same moderator.</p>

      <h2 id="faq">7. FAQ</h2>
      <p><strong>Can I DM a DCT mod directly?</strong><br>→ No. All communication must go through official NOIZ systems or inbox tools.</p>
      <p><strong>What if I think a DCT member is biased against me?</strong><br>→ Request escalation. You may ask for Staff Admin review once per case.</p>
      <p><strong>Can I stream about my ban or appeal?</strong><br>→ Yes, but you <strong>may not lie or encourage harassment</strong>. Doing so may escalate your case.</p>
      <p><strong>Will appealing make my punishment worse?</strong><br>→ No — unless you <strong>violate policy during the appeal</strong> (e.g., harassing staff or breaking rules again).</p>
