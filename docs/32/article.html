      <h2 id="music-is-the-1-dmca-risk-for-creators">Music Is the #1 DMCA Risk for Creators</h2>
      <p>Music is one of the most common causes of copyright enforcement on streaming platforms — and NOIZ is no exception. Even if you've purchased a song on Spotify, iTunes, or another service, <strong>you do not own the rights to publicly broadcast it on stream</strong>.</p>
      <p>DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) applies to both <strong>live broadcasts and VOD replays</strong>. NOIZ honors valid takedown notices from rights holders, including music publishers, labels, and licensing platforms.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Just because you can listen to it doesn’t mean you can stream it.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="what-music-is-safe-to-use">What Music Is Safe to Use</h2>
      <p>You can <strong>safely use</strong> the following types of music in your stream:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Original music</strong> you composed and performed yourself</li>
        <li><strong>Licensed tracks</strong> that grant you the right to use them in public or streamed broadcasts</li>
        <li><strong>Royalty-free libraries</strong> with explicit permission for streaming (check the usage rights!)</li>
        <li><strong>NOIZ Marketplace music packs</strong> marked as “stream-safe” or “licensed for live broadcast”</li>
        <li><strong>Certain indie game soundtracks</strong>, as long as the developer grants permission (many do)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Look for clear license language like: “OK for streaming,” “Public broadcast allowed,” or “Live use permitted.”</p>

      <h2 id="what-music-is-not-safe-to-use">What Music Is Not Safe to Use</h2>
      <p>These are <strong>not safe</strong> to stream:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music</strong> — these services are for personal use only</li>
        <li><strong>YouTube lyric videos, karaoke tracks, or remixes</strong> unless clearly marked as usable</li>
        <li><strong>Commercial music playing in your background</strong> (e.g., from a radio, car, or public space)</li>
        <li><strong>User-submitted tracks</strong> that aren’t verified with a proper license or explicit permission</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Using these sources puts you at risk for takedowns, account flags, or muted VODs — even if you’re not the one playing the music directly.</p>

      <h2 id="how-to-make-sure-your-music-is-stream-safe">How to Make Sure Your Music Is Stream-Safe</h2>
      <p>Always confirm the <strong>license type</strong> before using music on stream. You need the right to use it in <strong>live public broadcasts</strong>, not just private playback.</p>
      <p>Trusted sources include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>StreamBeats</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Pretzel Rocks</strong> (be sure to check the license filters)</li>
        <li><strong>Incompetech</strong> (many tracks are royalty-free with attribution)</li>
        <li><strong>NOIZ Marketplace</strong> — curated packs with explicit tags for stream use</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you're unsure whether the license applies to streaming, <strong>don’t use it</strong>.</p>

      <h2 id="game-music-and-licensed-titles">Game Music and Licensed Titles</h2>
      <p>Many games include music that’s safe to use — but others include licensed tracks that can result in takedowns.</p>

      <p>When in doubt, <strong>mute the music channel</strong> of the game or toggle off licensed tracks in the settings.</p>

      <h2 id="what-about-covers-remixes-or-ai-generated-tracks">What About Covers, Remixes, or AI-Generated Tracks?</h2>
      <p>Even if you perform or remix music yourself, the original composition still has copyright protection.</p>
      <p>Covers still require:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Composition rights</strong> (typically obtained through a mechanical license)</li>
        <li><strong>Streaming rights</strong> for the performance (separate from the composition)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Remixes and AI-generated tracks must:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be <strong>completely original</strong>, or</li>
        <li>Use material from the <strong>public domain</strong>, or</li>
        <li>Be <strong>properly licensed</strong> (with permission from all rights holders)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your remix samples a copyrighted track — even briefly — it is not safe to use.</p>

      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
      <p><strong>Can I sing copyrighted songs live?</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>No — unless you have explicit rights to the composition. Live covers are still subject to copyright law.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>What if someone donates a sound with copyrighted music?</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>You are responsible for any content that plays on your stream, including alerts and user-submitted clips.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>Can I play music only during breaks or intros?</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Same rules apply. Music in intro screens still counts as broadcasted content.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>How do I upload a music pack to the Marketplace?</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Go to: Dashboard → Marketplace → New Listing → “Audio Pack”. You must include a license field confirming stream-safe usage.</p>
