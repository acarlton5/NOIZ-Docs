      <h2 id="what-this-policy-covers">What This Policy Covers</h2>
      <p>This document explains how Decibels — both faded (dB) and charged (⚡︎dB) — are viewed, tracked, and used within the NOIZ ecosystem.</p>
      <p>It also defines how Constellation functions as a token access ledger, not a wallet, bank, or financial storage system.</p>

      <h2 id="what-is-constellation">What Is Constellation?</h2>
      <p>Constellation is NOIZ’s official identity and access system. It securely connects your NOIZ account to your token ledger and platform authorizations.</p>
      <p>It provides:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A view of your dB total (faded, support-only tokens)</li>
        <li>A view of your ⚡︎dB total (charged, cashout-eligible tokens)</li>
        <li>Your interaction history and active connections</li>
        <li><strong>Important:</strong> Constellation does not act as a wallet or financial account. It is not a storage service for real-world money or speculative assets.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>dB (faded Decibels) are used to support others, unlock cosmetic assets, and participate in platform systems.</li>
        <li>Once used to support a creator, dB convert into ⚡︎dB for that creator.</li>
        <li>⚡︎dB (charged Decibels) can be redeemed if monetization criteria are met.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="db-usage-guidelines">dB Usage Guidelines</h2>
      <p>dB may be used to:</p>
      <ul>

        <li>Boost streams or fund Quest progress</li>
        <li>Unlock digital items from Artists and Developers</li>
        <li>Interact with platform features (e.g., Reverb, chat plugins)</li>

      <h2 id="internal-only-system">Internal-Only System</h2>
      <p>NOIZ operates as a closed digital ecosystem. As such:</p>
      <ul>

        <li>No third-party token swaps are supported</li>
        <li>External marketplaces are not connected to NOIZ</li>
        <li>All activity is tracked internally to ensure transparency and compliance</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="misuse-abuse-prevention">Misuse &amp; Abuse Prevention</h2>
      <p>Attempting to manipulate the system — such as converting dB into ⚡︎dB by supporting yourself — may result in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Monetization suspension</li>
        <li>Reversal of ⚡︎dB</li>
        <li>Platform sanctions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>NOIZ is committed to maintaining a fair and abuse-resistant support system.</p>

      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Can I convert dB into ⚡︎dB manually?</dt>
        <dd>No. dB only convert into ⚡︎dB when given to another user as support.</dd>
        <dt>Can I transfer ⚡︎dB to another creator?</dt>
        <dd>Not directly. All support must come from viewers or participants — not from yourself.</dd>
        <dt>What if I accidentally supported the wrong person?</dt>
        <dd>Contact NOIZ Support. In most cases, Decibel support actions are final once processed.</dd>
