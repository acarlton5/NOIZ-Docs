      <h2 id="what-this-policy-covers">What This Policy Covers</h2>
      <p>This document outlines how Decibels (dB) and Charged Decibels (⚡︎dB) function within the NOIZ platform—including how they are stored, viewed, and transferred between users.</p>
      <p>It also clarifies that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Constellation</strong> acts as an <strong>access ledger</strong>, not a wallet, exchange, or banking service.</li>
        <li><strong>dB and ⚡︎dB are digital support tokens</strong>—never legal tender or financial instruments.</li>
          <li>Redemption rules apply <strong>only to ⚡︎dB</strong>, and only if earned through community activity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This policy is designed to protect NOIZ’s legal compliance, discourage abuse, and ensure that our reward systems are fair, non-speculative, and platform-contained.</p>

      <h2 id="what-is-constellation">What Is Constellation?</h2>
      <p><strong>Constellation</strong> is the access and identity system used across the NOIZ ecosystem. In addition to authentication, it acts as your <strong>virtual token container</strong>, tracking and displaying:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your <strong>dB</strong> balance (Decibels you’ve unlocked to support creators)</li>
        <li>Your <strong>⚡︎dB</strong> balance (Charged Decibels you’ve earned from others)</li>
        <li>Your <strong>transaction history</strong> (sent, received, or earned)</li>
        <li>Your <strong>connected apps and services</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Importantly, <strong>Constellation is <em>not</em> a financial wallet</strong>. It cannot:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hold fiat funds</li>
        <li>Facilitate withdrawals beyond what NOIZ explicitly allows</li>
        <li>Interact with external marketplaces or cryptocurrencies</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It’s a <strong>closed system</strong>, similar to digital credits in a game or tokens on a loyalty platform.</p>

            <td>Unlocked through Constellation</td>
            <td>✅ Yes</td>
            <td>❌ No</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>⚡︎dB</td>
            <td>Earned via support actions on NOIZ</td>
            <td>✅ Yes</td>
            <td>✅ Yes (if eligible)</td>
          </tr>

      </table>
      <p><strong>dB</strong> are <em>faded</em> Decibels—they’re acquired by unlocking support tokens in Constellation and can only be used to interact within the platform. Once dB are used to support another user (e.g., through tipping, gifting subs, or marketplace actions), they <strong>become ⚡︎dB</strong> for that user.</p>
      <p>This system ensures that only <strong>earned support</strong>, not unlocked tokens, become eligible for redemption.</p>

      <h2 id="db-usage-rules">dB Usage Rules</h2>
      <p>Your <strong>dB balance</strong> can be used for digital support actions such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tipping creators</li>
        <li>Gifting subscriptions</li>
        <li>Boosting streams</li>
        <li>Unlocking marketplace items (e.g., emotes, overlays, plugins)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>However:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Once used, <strong>dB cannot be refunded</strong> (unless a verified system error occurs)</li>
        <li><strong>dB cannot be redeemed</strong> under any circumstance</li>
        <li><strong>dB are not legal tender</strong>, and cannot be used to obtain physical or off-platform goods</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Think of dB as <strong>support tokens</strong>—they unlock digital participation and engagement, but hold no financial entitlement or exchange value.</p>

      <h2 id="db-eligibility-access">⚡︎dB Eligibility &amp; Access</h2>
      <p>Charged Decibels (<strong>⚡︎dB</strong>) can only be <strong>earned</strong>, never bought.</p>
      <p>To <strong>earn ⚡︎dB</strong>, you must receive support from others via:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gifted subs</li>
        <li>Tips and boosts</li>
        <li>Quest completions</li>
        <li>Marketplace redemptions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To <strong>redeem ⚡︎dB</strong>, you must meet all of the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Reach Affiliate status</strong> or higher</li>
        <li><strong>Complete legal identity verification (KYC)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Hold at least 10,000 ⚡︎dB</strong> in your account</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You may also use ⚡︎dB <strong>in-platform</strong> for the same actions as dB (e.g., tipping other creators), or save it for redemption once eligible.</p>

      <h2 id="internal-only-exchange-model">Internal-Only Exchange Model</h2>
      <p>NOIZ is a <strong>closed economy</strong>—Decibel transactions and balances are strictly limited to the NOIZ platform and Constellation ecosystem.</p>
      <p>NOIZ does <strong>not support</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Crypto-asset transactions or tokens</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Fiat withdrawals</strong> outside of approved ⚡︎dB redemption</li>
        <li><strong>Third-party trading</strong>, resale, or swaps</li>
        <li><strong>NFTs or token speculation</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>All activity is <strong>internally monitored</strong> and <strong>legally firewalled</strong> to prevent misuse or misrepresentation of Decibels as financial assets.</p>

      <h2 id="misuse-account-flagging">Misuse &amp; Account Flagging</h2>
      <p>Attempting to <strong>exploit</strong> the Decibel system—particularly by converting dB into ⚡︎dB through artificial or self-driven actions—is prohibited.</p>
      <p>Examples of prohibited behavior include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tipping yourself</strong> using alternate accounts</li>
        <li><strong>Looping dB through shell accounts</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Attempting to bypass KYC verification</strong> for redemption</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If abuse is detected, NOIZ may:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Flag your account</strong> for review</li>
        <li><strong>Remove ⚡︎dB</strong> that was gained improperly</li>
        <li><strong>Restrict monetization access</strong> or freeze redemption privileges</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our priority is to keep the system safe for creators who participate fairly.</p>

      <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Can I convert my dB to ⚡︎dB directly?</dt>
        <dd>No. dB becomes ⚡︎dB <em>only</em> when another user supports you with them.</dd>
        <dt>Can I send ⚡︎dB to another creator?</dt>
        <dd>Yes—⚡︎dB can be used just like dB for support actions. However, ⚡︎dB received from others still counts toward your redeemable balance.</dd>
        <dt>What if I accidentally support the wrong user?</dt>
        <dd>Support actions are final. You may open a support ticket for review if a <strong>verified mistake or exploit</strong> occurred.</dd>
        <dt>Can I use Decibels on other platforms or tools?</dt>
        <dd>No. Decibels are <strong>exclusive to NOIZ and Constellation</strong>. They are not portable or usable elsewhere.</dd>
