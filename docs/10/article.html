      <h2 id="yes-you-can-earn-before-affiliate">Yes — You Can Earn Before Affiliate</h2>
      <p>On NOIZ, creators are eligible for monetization as soon as they verify their identity and complete required legal documents. You don’t need to be a badge-holding Affiliate or Partner to start earning ⚡︎dB.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>⚡︎dB (Charged Decibels) can be earned through platform activity immediately after onboarding</li>
        <li>You do not need to hit a viewer count, follower number, or stream hour minimum to unlock monetization</li>
        <li>The Affiliate badge does not gate access to cashout — legal verification is the only requirement</li>
        <li>NOIZ separates badges from monetization to support creators from day one, without artificial milestones</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="how-you-can-accumulate-db-early">How You Can Accumulate ⚡︎dB Early</h2>
      <p>Once your legal forms are complete, you're fully eligible to earn and withdraw ⚡︎dB.</p>
      <p>You earn ⚡︎dB when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Viewers support you with Decibels (subs, boosts, tips, etc.)</li>
        <li>Subs are gifted to your channel (each 500 dB sub becomes ⚡︎dB)</li>
        <li>Viewers complete Quests on your channel</li>
        <li>Users support your Marketplace listings (if you’re an Artist or Developer)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>⚡︎dB accumulates through direct community support — it is never earned by purchasing Decibels yourself.</p>

      <h2 id="what-the-affiliate-badge-actually-unlocks">What the Affiliate Badge Actually Unlocks</h2>
      <p>The Affiliate badge is a recognition level — not a gate to monetization.</p>
      <p>What it changes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Revenue split increases (from Verified to Affiliate, you go from 50% to 60%)</li>
        <li>Sub badge visibility in other chats (Affiliate becomes your default chat badge outside your own channel)</li>
        <li>Unlocks additional emote slots, support badge tiers, and access to certain analytics</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It does not unlock monetization or cashout — those begin once you're verified and complete your paperwork.</p>

      <h2 id="why-monetization-starts-early">Why Monetization Starts Early</h2>
      <p>Unlike Twitch or YouTube, NOIZ doesn't wait until you're "big enough" to be rewarded.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>⚡︎dB earned before Affiliate can be cashed out at any time — no need to reapply or reach a tier</li>
        <li>Every viewer action that supports you helps your long-term growth</li>
        <li>Affiliate, Partner, and Partner+ simply enhance your tools and recognition — they don’t unlock earning</li>
        <li>NOIZ believes creators should be rewarded for activity and community support — not artificial thresholds</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="what-you-can-do-with-db-pre-affiliate">What You Can Do With ⚡︎dB Pre-Affiliate</h2>
      <p>With even a single ⚡︎dB in your account, you already have access to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cashout tools (once you hit the 10,000 ⚡︎dB minimum)</li>
        <li>Monetization dashboard (support history, top contributors)</li>
        <li>Progress tracking for badge milestones</li>
        <li>Participation in sponsored Quests (if available)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your journey as a monetized creator starts the moment your legal access is cleared — badges are just recognition, not requirements.</p>

      <h2 id="tips-to-grow-faster-optional">Tips to Grow Faster (Optional)</h2>
      <p>If you're working toward Affiliate or beyond, these can help:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stream consistently — the algorithm values activity over size</li>
        <li>Use correct stream tags and maturity labels for visibility</li>
        <li>Enable and refresh Quests often to drive engagement</li>
        <li>Participate in platform-wide events and Quest chains</li>
        <li>Let viewers know they can support with dB — but never pressure or guilt</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Badges will come naturally as you engage and grow.</p>

      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Can I earn ⚡︎dB without the Affiliate badge?</dt>
        <dd>Yes. Once verified, you are fully monetized and can cash out ⚡︎dB as long as you've reached 10,000.</dd>
        <dt>What is the purpose of the Affiliate badge then?</dt>
        <dd>It’s a recognition tier — it improves your rev split, unlocks cosmetic perks, and signals trust to viewers.</dd>
        <dt>Do I need to apply for Affiliate?</dt>
        <dd>No. NOIZ automatically awards badge tiers once you meet progression thresholds.</dd>
        <dt>If I hit 10,000 ⚡︎dB before Affiliate, can I cash out?</dt>
        <dd>Yes, absolutely — as long as your legal documents are complete and your account is verified.</dd>
