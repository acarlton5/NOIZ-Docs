      <h2 id="1-what-is-the-developer-role-on-noiz">1. What Is the Developer Role on NOIZ</h2>
      <p>Developers create interactive and functional tools for the NOIZ ecosystem, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plugins (polls, games, alerts, minigames)</li>
        <li>Overlay packs and UI extensions</li>
        <li>Custom integrations for streamers</li>
        <li>Tools that enhance viewer interaction or automate chat functions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are two types of Developers:</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Role</th><th>Description</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td><strong>Community Developers</strong></td><td>External creators who build tools, plugins, or overlays — rewarded via Dev Quests or Marketplace ⚡︎dB unlocks</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>Staff Developers</strong></td><td>NOIZ employees who build core platform features or moderate plugin security</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Only <strong>Community Developers</strong> carry the public Developer badge — identifying third-party contributors in chat and on profiles.</p>
