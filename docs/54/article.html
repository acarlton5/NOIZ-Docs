        <p><strong>Resonance Stickers are chat-activated effects that let you show off your support in style. They range from simple chat animations to full-screen stream reactions — and they always match the Decibels you choose to spend.</strong></p>

      <h2 id="what-are-resonance-stickers">💬 What Are Resonance Stickers?</h2>
      <p>Resonance Stickers are special visual (and sometimes audio) effects that appear in chat or across the stream when you support a creator using Decibels.</p>
      <p>Think of them like themed reactions — a splash of flair that happens when you send dB.</p>

      <h2 id="how-do-they-work">💸 How Do They Work?</h2>
      <p>Each sticker is linked to a specific Decibel amount. When you use one:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It activates the effect for everyone watching</li>
        <li>The streamer receives support based on the Decibel amount you chose</li>
        <li>The sticker effect is tied to that support — it doesn’t change the amount</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Water Splash</strong> costs <strong>50 dB</strong> → light splash in chat</li>
        <li><strong>Fireball Burst</strong> costs <strong>500 dB</strong> → animated fireball on stream + chat impact</li>
        <li>You can’t adjust the price — each sticker is pre-set by its design level</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="how-do-i-get-more-stickers">🎁 How Do I Get More Stickers?</h2>
      <p>You start with a default set — but you can unlock more by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Opening <strong>Echo Capsules</strong> (random cosmetic unlocks)</li>
        <li>Completing certain <strong>platform quests or achievements</strong></li>
        <li>Participating in <strong>seasonal or sponsored events</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you unlock a sticker:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It’s added to your collection</li>
        <li>You can select it when choosing a support tier</li>
        <li>It stays tied to your account</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="what-are-echo-capsules">📦 What Are Echo Capsules?</h2>
      <p>Echo Capsules are NOIZ’s version of cosmetic reward packs. They may contain:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Emotes</li>
        <li>Avatar decorations</li>
        <li>Chat effects</li>
        <li>Resonance Stickers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If a capsule grants you a sticker, it means you now <em>own</em> that effect — you still spend Decibels to trigger it.</p>

      <h2 id="can-i-trade-or-sell-stickers">🔁 Can I Trade or Sell Stickers?</h2>
      <p>No — stickers are yours once unlocked and can’t be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Traded</li>
        <li>Gifted</li>
        <li>Sold</li>
        <li>Converted to Decibels</li>
      </ul>
      <p>They’re designed to be personal cosmetic upgrades — not currency.</p>

      <h2 id="how-do-i-use-a-sticker-on-stream">📚 How Do I Use a Sticker on Stream?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Click the <strong>support icon</strong> under the stream</li>
        <li>Choose the <strong>Decibel amount</strong> you want to send</li>
        <li>Pick an unlocked sticker from your collection</li>
        <li>Confirm — and your sticker blasts off into chat or the stream!</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You can switch stickers at any time — or just send plain support with no sticker if you prefer.</p>
