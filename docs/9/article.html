      <h2 id="creator-progression-faq">Creator Progression FAQ (Verified / Affiliate / Partner / Partner+)</h2>

      <h2 id="what-are-the-creator-progression-levels-on-noiz">What Are the Creator Progression Levels on NOIZ?</h2>
      <p>NOIZ recognizes creators through a structured tier system that reflects platform activity, support, and engagement — not vanity metrics.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Verified:</strong> Entry recognition for creators with consistent activity and completed onboarding</li>
        <li><strong>Affiliate:</strong> First monetized badge tier (unlocks cashout and support tools)</li>
        <li><strong>Partner:</strong> Mid-tier for creators with strong community interaction and platform presence</li>
        <li><strong>Partner+:</strong> Top-tier for long-term builders, community leaders, or official platform collaborators</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each level brings new visibility, access, and earning opportunities.</p>

      <h2 id="what-does-verified-mean">What Does “Verified” Mean?</h2>
      <p>Verification marks your channel as established and trusted. It’s typically auto-assigned after:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Consistent activity</li>
        <li>Account completion and Constellation handshake</li>
        <li>Legal identity verification</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>What Verified Unlocks:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Customization of Reverb (channel points)</li>
        <li>Quest creation tools</li>
        <li>Use of core moderation tools</li>
        <li>Appearance in platform-wide discovery and search</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Verification does not require a large audience — it’s based on real interaction and consistency.</p>

      <h2 id="how-do-i-become-a-partner">How Do I Become a Partner?</h2>
      <p>Partner status is earned, not applied for. The system tracks your organic platform activity.</p>
      <p><strong>Metrics Used:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Streaming frequency and Quest usage</li>
        <li>Viewer activity (⚡︎dB earned, Reverb redemptions, Vibe reactions)</li>
        <li>Boosts and gifted subs from others</li>
        <li>Adherence to maturity labels and category accuracy</li>
        <li>Completion of internal platform achievements</li>
      </ul>
      <p>NOIZ does not use follower count or force creators to “apply with 75 average viewers.” Growth is measured by quality and consistency.</p>

      <h2 id="what-do-partners-get">What Do Partners Get?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Higher priority in Echostage rotations</li>
        <li>Sponsored Quest eligibility</li>
        <li>Full Marketplace participation (if Artist or Developer)</li>
        <li>Early access to new tools and experiments</li>
        <li>Advanced dashboard metrics (Boost trends, Quest analytics)</li>
        <li>Partner badge in chat and profile</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="what-is-partner-plus">What Is Partner+?</h2>
      <p>Partner+ is a special designation for creators who:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintain long-term platform growth</li>
        <li>Complete verified sponsorship or platform campaigns</li>
        <li>Lead community development efforts</li>
        <li>Are selected for experimental programs or early integrations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Partner+ is assigned manually or auto-granted when milestone thresholds are passed. It’s the highest visible badge level on NOIZ.</p>

      <h2 id="how-is-progression-tracked">How Is Progression Tracked?</h2>
      <p>NOIZ tracks metrics internally — no public leaderboards or vanity scoreboards.</p>
      <p><strong>Considered Metrics:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>⚡︎dB earned from others (not self)</li>
        <li>Chat engagement: Reverb, emotes, boosts</li>
        <li>Quest participation and viewer completion rates</li>
        <li>Streaming consistency (not just hours)</li>
        <li>Maturity rating accuracy and content stability</li>
        <li>Achievement system progression (not public unless chosen)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="can-you-lose-status">Can You Lose Status?</h2>
      <p>Yes — NOIZ uses a decay-based progression cycle:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your Creator Level resets to Level 1 each calendar year</li>
        <li>You retain your highest badge tier for the next full year, regardless of activity</li>
        <li>If you don’t re-earn the requirements for that badge within the new year, you’ll drop to the highest tier you did earn</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Example: You become a Partner+ in 2025. You keep the Partner+ badge and perks until the end of 2026. If in 2026 your metrics fall to Affiliate level, you’ll display Affiliate in 2027.</p>
      <p>This helps ensure badges reflect current and active creators, not inactive legacy accounts.</p>
      <p><strong>Status Will Not Be Removed For:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Short breaks, vacations, or health issues</li>
        <li>Changing content styles or exploring new categories</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Status Can Be Removed For:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Policy violations or community harm</li>
        <li>Fraudulent activity, including view botting or abuse of boosts</li>
        <li>Violation of monetization rules</li>
        <li>Repeated infractions after DCT or Staff Admin review</li>
      </ul>
