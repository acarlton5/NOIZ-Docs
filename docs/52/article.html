      <blockquote>
        <p>Transparency is a key pillar of safety and trust on NOIZ. This document outlines how moderation data is shared, how user enforcement history is tracked, and what protections are in place to keep things fair and private.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="1-what-are-transparency-reports">1. What Are Transparency Reports?</h2>
      <p>Transparency Reports are platform-published summaries that show:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>📥 <strong>How many reports</strong> were submitted or auto-flagged</li>
        <li>📑 <strong>What types of violations</strong> were reported</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>What actions</strong> were taken by the DCT</li>
        <li>📈 <strong>How appeals were handled</strong></li>
        <li>⏱️ <strong>Average resolution time</strong> for different case types</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These are released <strong>quarterly or bi-annually</strong> to demonstrate fair enforcement practices without revealing private details.</p>

      <p>These reports exist to show that NOIZ:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Upholds platform safety <strong>without shadow enforcement</strong></li>
        <li>Does not secretly punish or hide bad actors</li>
        <li>Follows a visible <strong>audit-friendly process</strong></li>
        <li>Balances creator freedom with platform integrity</li>

      <h2 id="5-user-enforcement-history">5. User Enforcement History</h2>
      <p>Every NOIZ account includes a <strong>private moderation log</strong>, visible only to:</p>

        <li>🛡️ <strong>DCT reviewers</strong></li>
        <li>🧠 <strong>Staff Admins</strong> (if escalated)</li>
