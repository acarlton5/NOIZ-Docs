      <h2 id="what-this-policy-covers">What This Policy Covers</h2>
      <p>This document explains how NOIZ allocates and manages its internal token system &mdash; <strong>Decibels</strong> (<code>dB</code> and <code>⚡︎dB</code>) &mdash; across viewer quests, sponsored campaigns, relay infrastructure, and creator payouts. It also outlines how NOIZ controls token flow without financial speculation or inflationary mechanics to ensure long-term stability and compliance.</p>

      <h2 id="what-are-token-lockups">What Are Token Lockups?</h2>
      <p><strong>Token lockups</strong> are pre-reserved pools of <code>dB</code> or <code>⚡︎dB</code> held internally by NOIZ. They remain off-platform until activated through defined systems and exist to fund future quests, allocate Pathweaver rewards, support creator onboarding, or back sponsored events.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Locked tokens are centrally managed and cannot be accessed or speculated on by users.</li>
        <li>Once activated, pools have fixed amounts, are time or completion bound, and remain non-transferable until earned.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="how-quest-pools-work">How Quest Pools Work</h2>
      <p>Quests are powered by internally funded <strong>quest pools</strong> that distribute <code>dB</code> to viewers who complete goals. Each pool has a fixed supply and may target specific games, tags, or campaigns with defined completion conditions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Example:</em> A game studio funds a 500,000 <code>dB</code> pool for players who finish three quests in a week.</li>
        <li><em>Example:</em> A seasonal event includes a 50,000 <code>dB</code> milestone reward for top participants.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Unused quest pool <code>dB</code> expire at campaign end and are recycled for future events.</p>

      <h2 id="how-relay-hosts-are-rewarded">How Relay Hosts Are Rewarded</h2>
      <p>Pathweavers who host relay nodes earn <code>⚡︎dB</code> from a separate support reserve based on verified uptime, bandwidth served, and regional incentives. This model recognizes real infrastructure contributions without mining or speculative hosting.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rewards are non-transferable off-platform and subject to trust scoring and fraud audits.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="inflation-policy-without-crypto-jargon">Inflation Policy (Without Crypto Jargon)</h2>
      <p>NOIZ does not use inflationary supply mechanics. <code>dB</code> are minted only when purchased via Constellation, and <code>⚡︎dB</code> are created only when support flows from a real viewer to a creator. There is no mining, staking, or yield farming.</p>
      <p>Tokens exit the system when they are spent on subs, boosts, quests, or listings; when quest pools expire unused; or when <code>⚡︎dB</code> are cashed out or removed for policy violations.</p>

      <h2 id="why-this-system-is-stable">Why This System Is Stable</h2>
      <p>NOIZ maintains full control over token entry and exit points, support budgets, and platform reviews. Because it avoids cryptocurrency features and external speculation, the token system remains stable, fair, and legally sound.</p>

      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
      <h3 id="where-does-the-decibel-supply-come-from">Where does the Decibel supply come from?</h3>
      <p><code>dB</code> are minted when purchased via Constellation or reserved for quests and events. <code>⚡︎dB</code> are created only when <code>dB</code> are spent to support another user.</p>
      <h3 id="what-happens-to-expired-or-unused-quest-rewards">What happens to expired or unused quest rewards?</h3>
      <p>They expire after the campaign and are recycled into future event budgets. They cannot be claimed or stockpiled.</p>
      <h3 id="can-relay-hosts-mine-tokens">Can relay hosts “mine” tokens?</h3>
      <p>No. Pathweavers earn <code>⚡︎dB</code> as recognition for live infrastructure contribution. There is no mining, proof-of-work, or token speculation.</p>
      <h3 id="is-there-a-cap-on-how-many-decibels-can-exist">Is there a cap on how many Decibels can exist?</h3>
      <p>There is no fixed cap. Supply grows based on platform activity and demand but remains centrally controlled with no open market.</p>
