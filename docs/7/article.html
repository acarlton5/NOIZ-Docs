      <h2 id="how-games-work-on-noiz">How Games Work on NOIZ</h2>
      <p>Games are at the core of stream discovery, Quest routing, and viewer engagement on NOIZ. Each stream can be assigned to a recognized game or category, helping the platform understand the content’s context and route Quests, boosts, and Echostage placement accordingly.</p>
      <p>Categories aren't limited to just games — streamers can also select broader labels like “Just Talking,” “Creative,” or “Music” to better represent non-gameplay content. Each of these categories may feature platform-curated or sponsored Quests and appear in discovery tools across NOIZ.</p>

      <h2 id="finding-the-right-game-tag">Finding the Right Game Tag</h2>
      <p>When setting up your stream, the Game Tag selector helps you find the right match for your content. Simply type the name of the game or category, and a list of available matches will appear.</p>
      <p>Each game or category tag includes metadata such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Genre (e.g., Action, Puzzle, Roguelike)</li>
        <li>Platform (PC, Console, Mobile)</li>
        <li>Developer or Publisher (if verified)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Games linked to official publisher accounts on NOIZ are marked with a verified badge, making them eligible for sponsored Quests or official directory boosts.</p>

      <h2 id="requesting-a-new-game-tag">Requesting a New Game Tag</h2>
      <p>If the game you're streaming doesn’t appear in the list, you can submit a request through the <strong>Suggest a Game</strong> tool, located in your stream setup panel. This tool lets you provide all necessary details:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Game title</li>
        <li>Developer or publisher name</li>
        <li>Official website or storefront link</li>
        <li>Cover art or promotional image</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once submitted, the game will go through internal review before being added to the public directory. You’ll be notified once your suggestion is accepted or if more info is needed.</p>

      <h2 id="using-custom-stream-tags">Using Custom Stream Tags</h2>
      <p>Beyond game or category selection, custom tags allow creators to further define the tone or content of a stream. These tags might describe playstyle, objectives, or community focus. Common examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Speedrun</li>
        <li>First Playthrough</li>
        <li>Competitive</li>
        <li>Modded</li>
        <li>Co-op</li>
        <li>Chill Vibes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Custom tags affect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Viewer discovery filters</li>
        <li>Echostage routing decisions</li>
        <li>Quest assignment relevance (e.g., “watch a modded run”)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Use tags to guide the type of viewers and interactions you want to attract.</p>

      <h2 id="creating-channel-specific-tags">Creating Channel-Specific Tags</h2>
      <p>Creators with Partner or Partner+ status can create custom tag presets for their own channel. These allow for flexible re-use and automation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Set default tags for each stream category</li>
        <li>Trigger tags dynamically via bots or plugins</li>
        <li>Let viewers unlock temporary tags through quests or Reverb rewards</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These custom tags are cosmetic but help reinforce a channel's brand and discoverability.</p>

      <h2 id="tag-visibility-and-discovery">Tag Visibility and Discovery</h2>
      <p>All active tags are displayed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>On your stream thumbnail</li>
        <li>Inside your channel description</li>
        <li>On game and category pages</li>
      </ul>
      <p>NOIZ’s systems use tag metadata to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Refine search results and filters</li>
        <li>Recommend your stream to relevant viewers</li>
        <li>Route platform Quests and highlight eligible content for Echostage</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tag accuracy improves viewer experience and helps the platform better promote quality streams.</p>

      <h2 id="best-practices-for-tagging">Best Practices for Tagging</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Be accurate and honest. Misleading tags reduce your visibility and may flag your stream for moderation.</li>
        <li>Don’t over-tag. Stick to 3–5 meaningful tags that actually describe your content.</li>
        <li>Update tags when stream content shifts. If you switch games or change tone midstream, your tags should reflect that.</li>
        <li>Use tags as an extension of your stream’s identity. Let them help shape the viewer experience from first glance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>How long does it take for a suggested game to be reviewed?</dt>
        <dd>Most requests are reviewed within 3–5 business days, but sponsored or trending games may be prioritized.</dd>
        <dt>Can I tag multiple games in one stream?</dt>
        <dd>Only one game can be selected per stream, but you may describe others in your tags (e.g., “Variety Night”).</dd>
        <dt>Are tags required?</dt>
        <dd>Game or category tags are required. Custom tags are optional but strongly recommended.</dd>
        <dt>Do tags affect monetization or quests?</dt>
        <dd>Yes — some Quests are tag-sensitive (e.g., “Complete a Co-op stream”), and proper tagging can boost visibility and Echostage routing. Monetization eligibility itself is not impacted.</dd>
