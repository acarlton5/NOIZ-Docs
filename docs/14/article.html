      <h2 id="refund-philosophy-on-noiz">Refund Philosophy on NOIZ</h2>
      <p>NOIZ operates using Decibels, a platform-specific virtual support system. All actions involving Decibels — including subscriptions, tips, boosts, and marketplace unlocks — are framed as digital support or platform interaction, not sales.</p>
      <p>Because of this framing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Support actions are non-refundable, as they do not constitute the exchange of goods or services in the traditional sense.</li>
        <li>Refunds are limited to technical or policy violations — never for regret, misuse, or change-of-mind scenarios.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Refunds may be granted in specific cases such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unauthorized Decibel unlocks (e.g., account compromise)</li>
        <li>Duplicate charges or confirmed technical failures</li>
        <li>Rule-breaking behavior in Marketplace or Sponsored Quest systems</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="what-is-not-eligible-for-refund">What Is Not Eligible for Refund</h2>
      <p>To preserve the integrity of the support model, the following items cannot be refunded under any circumstance:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Subscriptions (500 dB) – All subscriptions are a form of support and include no tangible service or entitlement</li>
        <li>Tipping or boosting a creator – These are voluntary, non-transactional actions</li>
        <li>Gifted subs – Once gifted, support is delivered and cannot be retracted</li>
        <li>Quest contributions – Unless tied to a verified system failure or a revoked Sponsored Quest</li>
        <li>Completed dB unlocks – If Decibels were successfully delivered to your account, the transaction is considered fulfilled</li>
        <li><strong>Reminder:</strong> support is not ownership. There is no guarantee of content delivery, access, or performance when using Decibels.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="eligible-refund-situations">Eligible Refund Situations</h2>
      <p>You may be eligible for a refund in limited and specific cases, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unauthorized dB unlocks made via a compromised Constellation account</li>
        <li>System failures that result in:
          <ul>
            <li>Duplicate charges</li>
            <li>Decibels not being delivered after a confirmed transaction</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Marketplace violations, including:
          <ul>
            <li>Unlocking a stolen, duplicated, or misrepresented asset</li>
            <li>Receiving an asset that was later removed for policy violations</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Sponsored Quest fraud, such as:
          <ul>
            <li>Being directed to complete an action under false pretenses</li>
            <li>Incomplete or revoked campaigns that were improperly executed</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each case is manually reviewed by NOIZ staff.</p>

      <h2 id="how-to-request-a-refund">How to Request a Refund</h2>
      <p>To initiate a refund review, follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Visit the NOIZ Support Portal or your Constellation Transaction History</li>
        <li>Locate the transaction in question</li>
        <li>Click “Report an Issue”</li>
        <li>Submit a ticket including:
          <ul>
            <li>The transaction ID</li>
            <li>The date and time of the issue</li>
            <li>A brief description of the situation</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Refund requests are typically responded to within 3–5 business days, depending on volume and investigation needs.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="refunds-for-marketplace-issues">Refunds for Marketplace Issues</h2>
      <p>If you unlocked an asset from the Marketplace and believe it was fraudulent or broken:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Submit a Marketplace Support Ticket through your dashboard</li>
        <li>Include the asset name, creator name, and the issue (e.g., asset doesn’t load, was removed, or violates a rule)</li>
        <li>If the asset was unlocked using dB, a refund may be issued in dB</li>
        <li>If ⚡︎dB was used in error (e.g., through a system bug), platform staff may manually intervene</li>
        <li>False or abusive refund reports will result in your account being flagged, with potential limits on future refund eligibility.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="chargebacks-and-fraud-protection">Chargebacks and Fraud Protection</h2>
      <p>Chargebacks filed directly with your financial provider (e.g., credit card) bypass NOIZ’s dispute system and can have serious consequences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Automatic account restriction or ban</li>
        <li>Loss of access to pending ⚡︎dB or Marketplace tools</li>
        <li>Required KYC re-verification for future monetization eligibility</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you're unsure or concerned about a transaction, always open a ticket first — our team can help resolve issues faster and more safely than your financial provider.</p>

      <h2 id="refund-method-and-timing">Refund Method &amp; Timing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Most refunds will be returned as dB to your NOIZ account</li>
        <li>In rare or complex system issues, refunds may be re-routed through your original funding method</li>
        <li>In cases of technical failure, missing Decibels may be auto-restored without a formal refund process</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Refund timelines can vary depending on the funding processor, but most are completed within 5–10 business days once approved.</p>

      <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Can I refund a gifted sub I didn’t mean to send?</strong><br>No. All gifted subs are treated as final digital support and are non-refundable.</li>
        <li><strong>What if someone tipped me accidentally?</strong><br>Support actions like tipping are voluntary and irreversible. If someone sends dB or ⚡︎dB to your channel, it becomes eligible support.</li>
        <li><strong>Do refunds affect streamer ⚡︎dB earnings?</strong><br>In very rare cases, yes. If a refunded transaction included Decibel support and fraud is verified, ⚡︎dB may be removed from the recipient’s account.</li>
        <li><strong>Can I refund my own Marketplace listing unlock?</strong><br>Only if the asset is found to violate Marketplace policy (e.g., stolen artwork). Buyer remorse or creative mismatch is not grounds for a refund.</li>
      </ul>
