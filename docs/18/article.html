      <h2 id="why-disclosure-matters-on-noiz">Why Disclosure Matters on NOIZ</h2>
      <p>Transparency is essential to trust — especially in a creator-first ecosystem like NOIZ.</p>
      <p>Whether you're receiving ⚡︎dB, free items, visibility boosts, or brand partnership perks, <strong>you must disclose any form of sponsored content</strong>. This protects you and your viewers, and keeps NOIZ compliant with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>U.S. <strong>Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</strong> guidelines</li>
        <li><strong>International disclosure laws</strong> and advertising codes</li>
        <li><strong>NOIZ platform integrity policies</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Disclosure is about clarity, not punishment. Viewers deserve to know when what they're watching has been paid for or promoted.</p>

      <h2 id="what-counts-as-a-paid-promotion">What Counts as a Paid Promotion</h2>
      <p>A paid promotion is <strong>any content or interaction</strong> that is supported, funded, or rewarded by another entity — including NOIZ.</p>
      <p>You must disclose if you receive:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>⚡︎dB (Charged Decibels) from a brand, publisher, or sponsor</li>
        <li>Free products tied to expected coverage or exposure</li>
        <li>Paid or sponsored Quests</li>
        <li>Bonuses, boosts, or visibility based on content performance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Common examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Brand-sponsored Quests or campaigns</li>
        <li>Paid plugin showcases or overlay usage</li>
        <li>Product trials with the expectation of a shoutout</li>
        <li>Partnered co-streams, interviews, or event coverage</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p>If you’re receiving anything of value — whether digital or physical — <strong>and there’s an expectation to feature it</strong>, it qualifies as a paid promotion.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="how-to-disclose-properly">How to Disclose Properly</h2>
      <p>Disclosures must be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clear and unambiguous</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Visible or audible at the start</strong> of a stream, quest, or segment</li>
        <li><strong>Repeated as needed</strong>, especially for long broadcasts or repeated sponsored segments</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Acceptable formats:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sponsored tag: apply the platform's <code>[Sponsored]</code> tag to your stream or quest</li>
        <li>Visual overlay: watermark, banner, or “Sponsored by” tag</li>
        <li>Verbal: “This segment is sponsored by...” at the beginning</li>
        <li>Quest description: must clearly identify the sponsor</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Platform tools you should use:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sponsored Quest tag</strong> (when launching quests with brand backing)</li>
        <li><strong>Disclosure overlay widget</strong> (in development)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="what-not-to-do">What NOT to Do</h2>
      <p>Avoid vague or misleading references. Specifically, <strong>do not</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use phrases like “special thanks to...” without stating it’s paid</li>
        <li>Frame sponsored content as spontaneous or organic if it was pre-arranged</li>
        <li>Let the sponsor write viewer-facing content in your voice</li>
        <li>Tie viewer support to deceptive incentives like:
          <blockquote>
            <p>“Tip 1,000 dB and I guarantee a win”<br>
            “Support this and I’ll reveal a secret” (if not legitimate)</p>
          </blockquote>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Do I need to disclose if I support a brand voluntarily?</dt>
        <dd>No — only if the brand compensated you in ⚡︎dB, items, or visibility, or if there’s an expectation of coverage.</dd>
        <dt>What if I wasn’t paid in money, just Decibels?</dt>
        <dd>You still must disclose. ⚡︎dB is a virtual token of value on NOIZ and counts as compensation.</dd>
        <dt>Does viewer gifting or boosting count as promotion?</dt>
        <dd>Not unless they were part of a pre-arranged sponsorship or incentive program.</dd>
        <dt>Can I promote sponsors on social media or off-platform without disclosing?</dt>
        <dd>Disclosure laws apply across platforms. Even tweets or Instagram stories must be tagged if promotional.</dd>
