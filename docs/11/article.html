      <h2 id="what-are-chat-roles">What Are Chat Roles on NOIZ?</h2>
      <p>On NOIZ, chat roles are visual indicators that help identify a user’s status, trust level, or platform function. These badges appear in chat messages, user profiles, channel dashboards, and leaderboards. Roles serve cosmetic and functional purposes, highlighting contributors, moderators, builders, or official representatives.</p>
      <p>There are two main types of roles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Automatic roles</strong> – earned through platform activity (e.g. Affiliate, Sub Gifter, Quest Participant)</li>
        <li><strong>Assigned roles</strong> – granted manually by NOIZ staff or system triggers (e.g. DCT, Staff, Pathweaver, Ambassador)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Users can have multiple roles, but only one badge is shown in chat at a time; the highest‑trust or platform‑critical badge takes priority.</p>

      <h2 id="platform-wide-roles-and-their-badges">Platform-Wide Roles and Their Badges</h2>
      <p>These roles appear across all of NOIZ, not just within individual channels.</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Role</th><th>Description</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>NOIZ Staff</td><td>Employees including admins, legal/compliance, and support leads; use a unique badge color.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Staff Developer</td><td>Internal NOIZ developers building platform infrastructure; similar badge to “Developer” but with a staff color.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>DCT</td><td>Dissonance Compliance Team with global moderation powers.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Staff Admin</td><td>Senior staff handling legal moderation, KYC escalations, and sensitive reports; usually hidden unless acting officially.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Ambassador</td><td>Users who reach referral milestones and help grow the platform; badge is public in chat.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Sponsor</td><td>Verified developers, publishers, or brands running official Quest campaigns in partnership with NOIZ.</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2 id="automatic-roles-displayed-in-chat">Automatic Roles Displayed in Chat</h2>
      <p>These roles are granted automatically based on activity or support milestones.</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Role</th><th>Trigger</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>Affiliate</td><td>Creator has met monetization entry criteria and completed verification.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Partner</td><td>Creator meets higher trust and engagement thresholds; badge displayed by default.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Partner+</td><td>Legacy or standout creators with high-level privileges; badge shown in most views.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Sub Gifter</td><td>Viewer who gifts Decibel-based subs; badge color changes with total gifted (5 to 5000).</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Vibe Badge Holder</td><td>Badge visible only in the creator’s chat; earned through accumulated Vibe.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Support Milestone</td><td>Time-based or gifting milestones like 1 year subscribed or 1000 dB gifted.</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Gifter and Vibe badges stack separately from monetization badges. In your own channel, your time-based badge is shown by default unless manually changed.</p>

      <h2 id="role-display-priority-context">Role Display Priority &amp; Context</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>In their own chat, users display their time-based loyalty badge.</li>
        <li>In another creator’s chat, the platform-level badge (Affiliate, Partner, Partner+) is shown.</li>
        <li>Staff, Admin, or DCT badges override all others when acting in an official capacity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Badge switching or customization may become available depending on context and permissions.</p>

      <h2 id="future-role-expansions">Future Role Expansions</h2>
      <p>NOIZ plans to expand the role system with additional badges:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Verified Artist – for creators with listed Marketplace assets</li>
        <li>Verified Developer – for users who build approved plugins, overlays, and tools</li>
        <li>Pathweaver – for users who operate trusted relays and support platform infrastructure</li>
        <li>Quest Champion – for high quest engagement across campaigns</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These roles will follow the same color-coded badge structure and appear automatically once earned.</p>

      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
