      <h2 id="what-is-a-channel-editor">What Is a Channel Editor on NOIZ?</h2>
      <p>A Channel Editor is a trusted user role that creators can assign to help manage and maintain their streams, quests, and visual elements. Editors act as platform-level collaborators and have access to critical stream tools.</p>
      <p>Unlike Moderators, who are focused on chat behavior and enforcement, Editors directly interact with channel-level systems, stream metadata, and can even start or stop your stream.</p>
      <p><strong>Editors should be selected with care</strong> — they can impact your channel’s public-facing experience and represent you in key ways.</p>

      <h2 id="how-to-assign-an-editor">How to Assign an Editor</h2>
      <p>To add someone as an Editor:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to your Creator Dashboard</li>
        <li>Navigate to: Settings → Team Access</li>
        <li>Add the user via:
          <ul>
            <li>Their Constellation-linked user ID, or</li>
            <li>Their verified NOIZ channel name</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The invited Editor will receive a confirmation request. Access is not granted until accepted.</li>
        <li>You may remove or revoke Editor status at any time from this same panel.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="editor-permissions-overview">Editor Permissions Overview</h2>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Editor Ability</th><th>Description</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>Go Live / End Stream</td><td>Can start or stop a broadcast if using NOIZ Studio or RTMP setup</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Edit Stream Title, Tags, Game</td><td>Modify stream metadata, even while live</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Schedule or Adjust Viewer Quests</td><td>Create, schedule, or modify active viewer Quests</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Monitor Boosts &amp; Reverb Activity</td><td>See live engagement stats like Vibe, Reverb, and support flow (read-only)</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Review Chat Logs &amp; Reports</td><td>View moderation logs, flagged reports, and warning history (read-only)</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Create/Update Stream Overlays (if Artist)</td><td>Apply or modify visual overlay packs from the linked Marketplace</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Editors do not automatically become Moderators. These are distinct roles and must be assigned separately if both permissions are desired.</p>

      <h2 id="editor-access-and-trust">Editor Access and Trust</h2>
      <p>Editors represent your channel in various contexts.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Host other streams from your account</li>
        <li>Adjust metadata that appears in search or category directories</li>
        <li>Influence your presence on Echostage and stream discoverability</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Because of these abilities, Editors are accountability-linked to the creator. Choose team members you trust completely.</p>

      <h2 id="whats-the-difference-between-a-mod-and-an-editor">What's the Difference Between a Mod and an Editor?</h2>
      <p>While both are supportive roles, their function and risk levels are very different.</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Role</th><th>Primary Focus</th><th>Represents the Creator?</th><th>Platform Risk Level</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>Moderator (Mod)</td><td>Chat moderation, rule enforcement, emote controls</td><td>No – moderates chat behavior, not channel settings</td><td>Lower risk</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Channel Editor</td><td>Quest and overlay management, stream metadata, hosting</td><td>Yes – changes affect the creator’s channel directly</td><td>Higher risk</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p><strong>Key Difference:</strong><br>Mods focus on what happens in the chat. Editors manage what shows up on your page.</p>
      <p><strong>Important Note on Hosting:</strong><br>Editors can host another creator on your behalf. If that hosted stream violates NOIZ policies (e.g., mature content mislabeling), you may be held accountable under the Hosting Policy — even if you were not live at the time.</p>

      <h2 id="best-practices-for-managing-editors">Best Practices for Managing Editors</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Regularly review your Editor team for relevance and trust</li>
        <li>Revoke access immediately if trust is compromised</li>
        <li>Avoid assigning Editor status unless you’ve worked with the person before</li>
        <li>Clearly define expectations: editing tools vs chat behavior</li>
      </ul>
