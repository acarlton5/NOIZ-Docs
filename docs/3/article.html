      <h2 id="purpose">The Purpose of NOIZ</h2>
      <p>NOIZ was created to empower creators — not exploit them.</p>
      <p>Born out of frustration with legacy streaming platforms that prioritize ads, financial extraction, and restrictive control, NOIZ is built for those who want more than just another Twitch clone. Our team, composed of streamers, developers, artists, and infrastructure veterans, decided to build something better.</p>
      <p>NOIZ exists to challenge the systems that treat creators as commodities. Instead, we offer a platform where every user contributes to the ecosystem — whether they’re streaming, moderating, designing, coding, or simply watching.</p>
      <p>Our philosophy centers on ownership, interaction, and recognition over algorithms, vanity numbers, or transactional paywalls.</p>

      <h2 id="mission">Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>To build a creator-first streaming ecosystem that rewards participation, supports shared infrastructure, and evolves through community-driven design — not corporate control.</p>
      <p>This mission means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Support is framed as virtual recognition, not financial obligation.</li>
        <li>Our infrastructure is powered by contributors — Pathweavers — who run relay nodes to distribute stream content.</li>
        <li>Artists, developers, and streamers are treated equally as builders of the platform.</li>
        <li>Features evolve based on what our community needs, not what investors want.</li>
        <li>At NOIZ, we’re designing a system where creators can grow alongside the platform without needing permission, partnerships, or artificial gatekeeping.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="difference">What Makes NOIZ Different</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Decibel-Based Support:</strong> Instead of traditional fiat-based subscriptions, NOIZ uses Decibels (dB and ⚡︎dB), virtual support tokens that empower creators without financial framing.</li>
        <li><strong>Digital-Only Monetization:</strong> All monetization is built around in-platform rewards, not “sales.” Everything earned is tied to participation — never behind a paywall.</li>
        <li><strong>Relay-Driven Infrastructure:</strong> Rather than depending on central servers, streams are delivered through a network of trusted, community-hosted relays (run by Pathweavers). This avoids single points of failure and allows greater scalability.</li>
        <li><strong>Quest-Based Engagement:</strong> Viewers interact through Quests — tasks like watching, chatting, boosting, or gifting — earning rewards while deepening their connection to the stream.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparent Moderation:</strong> NOIZ’s moderation structure includes the DCT (Dissonance Compliance Team), Staff Admins, and platform tools. Enforcement actions are logged and tracked to ensure consistency and fairness.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="culture">NOIZ Culture &amp; Creator Philosophy</h2>
      <p>We are anti-grind.</p>
      <p>You won’t find public follower counts, arbitrary “Partner application” checklists, or leaderboard pressure. Instead, we track real engagement: consistent streaming, viewer support, community interaction.</p>
      <p>Our philosophy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Performance means creativity, consistency, and contribution — not popularity.</li>
        <li>Stream to build your community, not to climb a metric ladder.</li>
        <li>Focus on long-term relationships, not short-term virality.</li>
        <li>We believe creators deserve systems that reinforce health and sustainability, not pressure and burnout.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="decentralization">Decentralization Without Crypto</h2>
      <p>NOIZ is decentralized — but not in the way most platforms mean it.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No blockchain</li>
        <li>No NFTs</li>
        <li>No token speculation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our decentralization refers to infrastructure, not finance.</p>
      <p>Relay nodes — hosted by community members — deliver streams globally. These Pathweavers are rewarded with ⚡︎dB (charged Decibels) as a token of appreciation for uptime and support.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Constellation (our identity and linking system) acts as a ledger, not a wallet. It manages your account, permissions, balances, and plugin access — not your bank account.</p>
      <p>NOIZ’s systems are built for security, stability, and clarity — not buzzwords or crypto volatility.</p>

      <h2 id="vision">The Vision for NOIZ’s Future</h2>
      <p>We’re not just building a streaming site — we’re building a creator economy designed for the next decade.</p>
      <p>Future goals include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Expanding the Quest system into games, cooperative campaigns, and plugins</li>
        <li>Allowing community curation of Echostage (our dynamic spotlight system)</li>
        <li>Scaling the Marketplace for artists and developers to offer overlays, emotes, tools, and plugins</li>
        <li>Keeping NOIZ entirely self-sustaining — no external dependencies, no ad-based monetization, no investor takeovers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our growth will come from belief and participation, not capital and PR stunts.</p>

      <h2 id="what-not">What NOIZ is Not</h2>
      <p>Let’s be clear about what we are not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>❌ We are not crypto — no blockchain, tokens, or speculative economies.</li>
        <li>❌ We are not a Twitch clone — NOIZ was inspired by streaming’s potential, not its limitations.</li>
        <li>❌ We are not ad-funded — NOIZ runs zero ads. Sponsors engage through Quests, not banners or pre-rolls.</li>
        <li>❌ We are not hype-driven — we’re building systems that last, not chasing the next trend or platform war.</li>
        <li>❌ We are not pay-to-win — there are no token-based boosts, no inflated views, no botting loopholes. Every interaction is earned and tracked internally.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>NOIZ is for creators who want to build, grow, and belong. If that’s you — welcome home.</p>
