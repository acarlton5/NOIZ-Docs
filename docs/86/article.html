      <h2 id="how-rewards-work">How Rewards Work</h2>
      <p>NOIZ rewards Pathweavers using <strong>⚡︎Decibels (charged)</strong> from a <strong>platform-supported pool</strong> — not generated tokens.</p>
      <p>Relay nodes that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stay online consistently</li>
        <li>Handle real viewer traffic</li>
        <li>Improve streaming latency or reliability</li>
      </ul>
      <p>…are acknowledged via <strong>support-based incentives</strong>, similar to how viewers cheer streamers or streamers earn through Quests.</p>

      <h2 id="what-contributes-to-reward-payouts">What Contributes to Reward Payouts</h2>
      <p>Your node’s eligibility is calculated from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>📡 <strong>Uptime score</strong> – how often your relay is available</li>
        <li>🚀 <strong>Performance tier</strong> – amount of traffic handled + latency stability</li>
        <li>🌐 <strong>Regional impact</strong> – underserved region coverage may earn boosts</li>
        <li>🧩 <strong>Event support</strong> – assisting during spikes, campaigns, or Echostage routing</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>⚠️ Nodes that spoof activity, drop packets, or repeatedly fail handshakes are automatically flagged and excluded from rewards.</strong></p>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Performance tier is calculated automatically each week and displayed in your <strong>Node Dashboard</strong>.</p>

      <h2 id="support-pool-allocation">Support Pool Allocation</h2>
      <p>NOIZ allocates a portion of platform reserves for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>⚡︎dB distribution to qualifying nodes</li>
        <li>Platform routing improvements</li>
        <li>Hardware incentive campaigns (optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This system is <strong>not tied to viewer spending</strong> — it’s an internal infrastructure reward pool, similar in spirit to how partner incentives work on other platforms.</p>
      <p><strong>⚠️ Faded dB (purchased tokens) cannot be converted into relay credit. Only charged ⚡︎dB from platform support is eligible for cashout under existing thresholds.</strong></p>

      <h2 id="reward-timeline">Reward Timeline</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Rewards are calculated weekly, distributed monthly</li>
        <li>Pending ⚡︎dB is visible at: <strong>Dashboard → My Node → Relay Rewards</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bonus boosts may be given for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Participation in high-load events</li>
        <li>Geographic uniqueness</li>
        <li>Longstanding contribution (Pathweaver milestones)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="milestone-badges">Milestone Badges</h2>
      <p>Long-term relay operators can unlock:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🥉 <strong>Bronze Pathweaver</strong> – 3 months uptime</li>
        <li>🥈 <strong>Silver Relay Guardian</strong> – 6 months uptime</li>
        <li>🥇 <strong>Gold Backbone</strong> – 1+ year verified uptime</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These badges are <strong>visual only</strong> and not tied to increased payouts, but they signify major infrastructure contributions.</p>

      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Can I request higher rewards?</strong> → No — tiers are automated and internally reviewed</li>
        <li><strong>Can I view my node’s real-time rank?</strong> → Yes — under Relay Performance in your dashboard</li>
        <li><strong>Can I cash out faded dB earned from purchases?</strong> → No — only ⚡︎dB from actual support activity is eligible</li>
        <li><strong>What if I unplug my node mid-month?</strong> → Downtime affects tier eligibility for that reward cycle</li>
      </ul>
