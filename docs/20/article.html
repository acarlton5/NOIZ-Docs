      <h2 id="what-is-my-loot">What Is “My Loot”?</h2>
      <p>My Loot is your personalized dashboard that displays creator earnings and platform engagement rewards. It serves as your hub for reviewing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>⚡︎dB earned through subscriptions, gifts, tips, and boosts</li>
        <li>Campaign rewards and quest completions</li>
        <li>Marketplace or plugin unlocks tied to your content</li>
      </ul>
      <p>💡 “Loot” represents charged Decibels (⚡︎dB) earned from platform participation. It is not fiat currency, not payroll, and not a financial account.</p>

      <h2 id="db-vs-db-overview">⚡︎dB vs dB Overview</h2>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Source</th>
            <th>Cashout Eligible</th>
            <th>Appears In “Loot”?</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>dB</td>
            <td>Purchased by viewers</td>
            <td>❌ No</td>
            <td>Viewer-side spend activity</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>⚡︎dB</td>
            <td>Earned via support actions</td>
            <td>✅ Yes (if eligible)</td>
            <td>Creator reward &amp; tracker</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>🔎 You will only see ⚡︎dB totals in your cashout and reward panels. Faded dB (viewer-purchased) are never eligible for withdrawal and are not listed as your earnings.</p>

      <h2 id="loot-dashboard-panels">Loot Dashboard Panels</h2>
      <p>Your dashboard includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>⚡︎dB Balance — current eligible amount for use or cashout</li>
        <li>Pending ⚡︎dB — earned from streams still under validation or active campaigns</li>
        <li>dB Spend Log — how viewers supported your channel</li>
        <li>Gifting Activity — subs received, grouped by viewer</li>
        <li>Quest Impact — breakdown of viewer completions and reward triggers</li>
        <li>Boost Streaks — timelines for Reverb/dB-based boost chains</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="payout-eligibility-overview">Payout Eligibility Overview</h2>
      <p>This panel helps you understand where you stand for cashout:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>⚡︎dB total vs. 10,000⚡︎dB minimum</li>
        <li>Eligibility status (Affiliate and KYC completed?)</li>
        <li>Payout request status and next cycle timeline</li>
        <li>Notices for tool visibility (hidden until Affiliate level reached)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>🪙 NOIZ does not automatically convert your ⚡︎dB — you control when to request cashout.</p>

      <h2 id="how-to-read-your-activity-feed">How to Read Your Activity Feed</h2>
      <p>Each ⚡︎dB you earn is tracked in a filterable feed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Action Source (tip, sub, quest, plugin, etc.)</li>
        <li>Timestamp (date + time)</li>
        <li>Related Stream or Item (which session or Marketplace listing)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Filters available include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tips</li>
        <li>Subscriptions</li>
        <li>Gifts</li>
        <li>Campaign Quests</li>
        <li>Marketplace</li>
        <li>Boosts</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="privacy-viewer-support">Privacy &amp; Viewer Support</h2>
      <p>You control how support is displayed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hide ⚡︎dB totals from overlay and chat announcements</li>
        <li>Mute gift alerts during stream events or quests</li>
        <li>Show top supporters using built-in overlay plugin (optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>🔐 All visibility settings are adjustable per stream.</p>

      <h2 id="what-loot-is-not">What Loot Is Not</h2>
      <p>Let’s clarify what My Loot isn’t:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>❌ Not a bank account</li>
        <li>❌ Not a wallet</li>
        <li>❌ Not a financial service or earnings guarantee</li>
      </ul>
      <p>“Loot” represents platform-issued recognition — not money, not employment, not contractual payout.</p>
