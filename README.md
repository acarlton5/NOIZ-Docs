# NOIZ-Docs

Documentation for NOIZ Interactive

## Folder Structure

- `docs/` contains numbered document folders. Each folder represents a single document and includes:
  - `sidebar.html` – contains only the `<aside>` sidebar snippet

  - `article.html` – contains only the article section snippet. The example
    demonstrates a layout styled like Twitch Legal's Bookworm pages.

  - `table-of-contents.html` – contains only the table of contents snippet
- `docs/documents.json` lists each document's ID, title, a short `desccription` of the document, and tags.

Each folder mirrors DocBox's layout snippets. The example files (`docs/1/sidebar.html` and `docs/1/table-of-contents.html`) show only the snippet portions that get embedded into `document.html`.
